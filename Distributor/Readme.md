# MEWS Distributor

Distributor is a booking engine that lets customers create reservations in a hotel with MEWS PMS. The provided options are either a redirect to standalone page hosted by Mews, or a JavaScript widget which can be embedded into your website.

## Standalone

If you're not sure which version to use, go with the standalone option. It's the simplest way how to connect your website with the booking engine. We will provide you with a link to page where the Distributor is located. For further information, see [Standalone Distributor](./Standalone.md) or contact our sales team at sales@mewssystems.com

## Widget

If you are a developer, you might be interested in more advanced ways how to integrate the Distributor into your website. For more seamless experience, the Distributor JavaScript widget allows customers to book directly from website of your hotel without being redirected elsewhere. For more information, consult the [Distributor Widget](./Widget.md).

## API

In case you'd like to implement your own custom booking engine that would be connected with MEWS, you should have a look at [Distributor API](../Api/Distributor/). Please contact sales@mewssystems.com to activate this function.
