## Major Differences Versus Traditional Systems

### No Night Audit

One of the major changes we made is remove the night audit from the system, this has a few implications:
- **Accommodation charges**: these are traditionally posted during the night audit. Mews posts these charges at the time the booking is created/confirmed. So all future revenue is already recorded, but because its in the future, you can still amend it, change rates, cancel items, cancel bookings, etc.
- **No Shows**: you can set up an "editable history window" during which you can cancel or check-in no-shows or walk-ins after midnight. Once the editable history window expires, you will no longer be allowed to make changes to bookings, so its important that reception is aware, and these is a procedure in place for the handling of no-shows.
- **Reports**: traditionally as part of the night audit, the system spews out report after report. Mews however allows reports to be printed at any time, and they have a time filter on the report, so that you could run it between exact time periods. But in our philosofy the day changes at midnight, and revenue should fall in the day when its actually consumed, not when the PMS dictates it (due to night audit processes)

### Bills are linked to Guests not Rooms

In traditional PMS systems, bills are always linked to the rooms, in which guests are booked. So if you need to open a bill for a guest who is not staying in the hotel, you would have to open a thing called "paymaster" which is a dummy-room to which you can link the charged.
Mews however has linked all billing to Guest Profiles. So as long as there is a Guest Profile in the system, you are able to post charges against it, irrespective of whether or not there is a booking attached. Should you however post charges against a profile that does not have any booking linked to that profile, the Guest Profile will appear as "to be resolved" in the Guest Ledger. This will help you identify potential problematic accounts.
