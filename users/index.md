 <a name="Guide-Dashboard"></a>
##Dashboard

The dashboard is the home screen of the Mews Commander. It always gives an instant, quick, up-to-date overview of your hotel. Clicking on the Mews icon in the top left corner (of any screen in the system) directs you back to the dashboard screen, so the dashboard is never more than 1 click away.

The Sections of the Dashboard:

- **Housekeeping**: An instant view of how many rooms have been cleaned and still need to be cleaned today. This allows you to quickly review performance and any possible delays.
- **Front Office**: These 2 pie charts show how many check-ins/outs have been completed or are still to be completed within today.
- **Rooms**: This pie chart gives a breakdown of the housekeeping status of the different rooms in order to check the performance of housekeeping. You can quickly identify how many rooms have been cleaned and still require cleaning.
- **Occupancy**: What the occupancy is for the upcoming week, and which are the busy arrival/departure days.
- **Guest Satisfaction**: You always receive your most up-to-date ranking on TripAdvisor to ensure that everyone in the hotel is aware of the latest reviews and to ensure that guest happiness is at the forefront of everything they do. Mews will allow you to create a competitive set of up to 6 hotels against which you can measure your performance. To set this up, kindly inform your Mews representative.
- **Social Media**: You can instantly see your Facebook performance in terms of likes. Also, your Klout Score allows you to see how well your posts across the different social media platforms are performing with customers. Mews will allow you to create a competitive set of up to 6 hotels against which you can measure your performance. To set this up, kindly inform your Mews representative.
- **Guest Ledger** / **Open bills**: You get a snapshot view of the total unpaid balances that are outstanding from guest bills. This ensures constant and consistent follow-up and closing of guest bills. When you open this report, it will highlight in red the profiles with outstanding charges but not with a future reservation. These outstanding accounts should be reviewed carefully to ensure timely payment.
- **Profile Completion**: In order to ensure quality data input, you can immediately see how well your front office is updating guest profiles of the bookings that are in-house and arriving today. The bar chart easily shows the percentage of completion.
- **Reports**: From the dashboard you can access a variety of different reports. Clicking on the individual sections of the above-mentioned departments will direct you into a much more detailed report that breaks down the results for analysis.
- **Orders**: If you have the Mews Navigator installed at your hotel, then you will be able to review customer orders directly from this tab.
- **Messages**: If you have received any messages through the Mews Navigator, these will display in the Messages section. You can see if you have any unread or unresolved messages. Its important to always resolve messages as soon as possible, as it affects customer service if you do not.

 <a name="Search-Function"></a>
###Search Function

At the top of the screen you will find the search box. The search box will enable you to find bookings by using any of the following criteria. The search will begin as soon as you start typing the name.
- **Guest name** (Don't use commas in the search.)
- **E-mail address**
- **Mews Confirmation Number** - Mews System allocates confirmation numbers for bookings, which you can use to search.
- **OTA Confirmation Number** - If your hotel is connected through a Channel Manager, the system records the OTA confirmation numbers, and you can use these to identify bookings in the search box.
- **Channel Manager Confirmation Number** - If your hotel is connected through a Channel Manager, the system records the Channel Manager confirmation numbers, and you can use these to identify bookings in the search box.
- **Room Number**: In order to find a booking in-house based on the room number, type the complete number.
- **Group Name**: You can also search by the group name, note that group names cannot contain any spaces in them.

 <a name="Guide-Support"></a>
###Support

On the top of the screen you will find the question mark icon. When you click on the icon, you will find 3 options:

1. Contact Support: You can select this option if you need support. The system will ask you to give us a subject and description of the problem. It is always best to send us a screenshot of what you see on your screen. Try to give as much detail as possible, so that we can trace the occurrence on the backend. Try to share which booking or report with which filters, etc.
2. Guide: Well done! You found it. The Guide is the document you are currently reading.

 <a name="Multi-Property-Environment"></a>
###Multi-property Environment

If you are the Manager for multiple hotels, all using Mews Systems, you will be able to have all your hotels combined under 1 login for all your employees.

When the Admin of the hotel is creating profiles for the different users, you will need to create a user in each hotel. When you create a user in 2 or more hotels with the exact same e-mail address, the system will recognize this, and add the icon of a building on the top of the screen. When you select the building, it will give you an option to select all connected hotels, and you can instantly switch between properties.

 <a name="Your-Profile"></a>
###Your Profile

When you select the “Your Profile” icon at top of the screen, you will have several options.
Note: If you have created a guest profile in one or more of the hotels, your profile details will also show in this section, requesting more information.

**Personal Information**

- **Language**: Here you can select the language in which you would like to display the system. Currently the system is translated in English, Czech and Dutch. Note that the default language of the system is English, so if anything is missing a translation in the system, it will show this item in English by default.
- **Culture**: You can select the culture in which you would like to see the system displayed. It will show dates and numbers in the selected culture. For example if you select Czech, it will display the days of the week in Czech and require numbers such as 6.5 (six and a half) to be written as 6,5 (comma instead of the decimal point)
- **Default Account**: If you have access to multiple accounts, you can select which hotel you would like to have as your default hotel. When you next log in to the system, it will open that specific hotel by default.

**Profile Picture**

You can upload your profile photo into the Mews Commander, so that when you send messages through the system to other users, it will display your photo.

**Password**

If you would like to change the password, select "Change Password," and the system will prompt you for your current password and the new password you would like to set. For security reasons, DO NOT ever share your password with anyone else, even if the person claims to work at Mews.

Should you have forgotten your password, visit http://www.mews.li and press the button "Forgot Password.” The system will prompt you to input your e-mail address and will resend your password.

Customers are sent login details via their confirmation e-mail. Once their profile is created in the system, their login details are sent to the e-mail address provided.
Should you have a customer asking to reset their password or stating that they did not receive their login details, you can visit http://www.mews.li and press the button "Forgot Password." The system will prompt you to input the guest e-mail address and will resend the password.

 <a name="Customer-Profiles"></a>
##Customer Profiles

The Mews Commander supports 3 types of customer profiles:

- Customer Profile
- Company Profile
- Travel Agent Profile

 <a name="Customer-Profile"></a>
###Customer Profile

The customer profile is the personal profile of a guest within Mews. The profile is split up in the following 9 sub-sections:

- **Dashboard**: An overview of future bookings linked to this guest. Clicking on any of the bookings will direct you automatically to the reservation screen where you can review and manage the details. Should the person be assigned as a companion to a booking, you will also see these bookings on his/her dashboard.
You will also see an overview of all closed bills linked to the customer profile, and all orders that were made by the customer.
- **Profile**: Personal contact, address and passport details of the customer. If you press the "Print" button on this screen, it will allow you to print a customer registration card for the customer with all his prefilled details completed. Additionally if you have multiple profiles of the same customer, you can select the other customer in the "Merge" search field. When you select “Merge,” it will show you both profiles. Select the profile with the most complete details, and it will merge the other profile into the one you selected. This ensures that you keep the system clean.
This tab also includes a great "merging" option, which allows you to merge 2 customer profiles into 1, if you have by accident created an duplicate. Type the name of the customer profile you are trying to merge, then click "merge" and it will show you both profiles, select the one you would like to keep, and it will merge the details of the other one into that profile.
- **Internals**: Should your guests have specific comments that users of the system need to be aware of, you can customize different categories such as “VIP”, “Returning Customer” or “Previous Complaint.” You can also leave specific comments, which are then automatically linked to all future bookings of this guest. If you set up different profile categories, this will highlight the different profiles by underlining the profile name with a coloured line, giving the receptionist a subtle hint that he/she needs to review the profile comments. Should you require more categories, please contact your Mews representative. Should you have your POS connected to the PMS, then the button "Always Externally Chargeable" will enable payments to this account, even if you do not have a checked-in booking.
**Blacklisted** if you would like to blacklist a customer, then you can select this tickbox on the guest profile. It will prevent him/her from making a new booking either directly through the Mews Distributor or directly in the Mews Commander.
**Guest Profile Notes**: if you update the Guest Profile notes, these will print on the different reports (Reservations Report, Reservations Overview, Guest In House) ensuring all team members of the hotel see the comments of the guest each time they arrive.
- **Payments**: From this screen you can select different payment types and manage prepayments and preauthorization. Mews does not store full credit card data. For data security reasons, we store only the last 4 digits of guest ‘s cards and the card type. You also get an overview of the preauthorization taken against which card. Using the last 4 digits will allow you to identify the correct card in order to match it to the guest’s card and use the preauthorization. This will ensure the protection of your customer’s sensitive data.
- **Billing**: This screen shows all unpaid items on the guest profile that require settlement. The receptionists can select items and move them into the customer, company or travel agent bill, depending on who is required to settle the account. From this screen you may also assign the charges to another customer.

 <a name="Integrated-Payment-Solutions"></a>
####Integrated Payment Solutions
In order to innovate the way payments are taken within the PMS, we have done integrations with Braintree and Adyen. These companies are allowing storage of guest cards directly in the Mews Commander, once a card is stored in the system, this allows direct charging from the PMS, without requiring external credit card machines.

  https://vimeo.com/135146064

**Storing a Credit Card**
- To store a new online chargeable credit card, visit the "Payments" screen on the guest profile.
- Select the "New Credit Card" screen. The screen will open and have 2 main sections, the left is the section for online cards (Braintree & Adyen) and the right hand side is for cards that are being charged via an external terminal.
- Once you have stored a credit card, you will see a "Payment Gateway ID" which higlights that he card has been verified by the bank, and has now become chargeable through the system

**Taking a Preauthorization**
- To take a preauthorization, select the button, and a new screen will open asking how much money to preauthorize.
- Once you have taken the preauthorization, you will be taken back to the "Payments" screen on the guest profile. Next to the transaction you can either
 - Charge Preauthorization: if you would like to charge the preauthorization fully or partially (and release the remainder to the guest account automatically) you can select this option.
 - Delete: if you would like to release the preauthorization, select "delete" and we will communicate to the bank to release the transaction. Note that it may take up to 2 business days for Adyen to release the transaction.

**Taking a New Credit Card Deposit**
- If you would like to take a credit card payment, select the button "New Credit Card Deposit" and you can instantly fill in the amount and charge the card. The payment will be directly posted on the open guest bill.

https://vimeo.com/132029560

 <a name="E-mail-Addresses"></a>
####E-mail addresses

Key to guest profiles is the Guest E-mail address. This is the unique identifier for a customer, and it is used to identify duplicate profiles. Should a new booking be made with the same e-mail address through any channel, it will automatically merge bookings under 1 profile, to ensure you capture all customer history and future bookings in a central location.

You can also send a confirmation e-mail to a person who might not be the owner of the booking (for example a secretary or family member). When you are creating a new booking, there is a field that asks for a customer confirmation e-mail address. When you complete this, it will send a one-time confirmation to the contact person.

For the system to work in the most optimal way, its important to always try to obtain e-mail addresses of customers, so that we can invite them into the online check-in, and in the future also for the online check-out. If we do not have the guest e-mail, we are unfortunately not able to offer them these great services.

 <a name="Company-Profile"></a>
###Company Profile

In order to book company rates, track company bookings and statistics, and allow for company invoicing, you need to create and attach a company profile to bookings.

To create a new company profile, in the top menu, select the Profile icon and then select “Companies.” This will take you to a list of existing companies. It will also allow you to select “New Company,” which will create a new profile requiring completion of details.

Should a company have multiple branches, you will need to create the head-office as a new company. In the profiles of the branch offices, you can easily assign the head-office as “Mother Company,” which tracks the full statistics of the company under 1 main profile.

 <a name="Travel-Agent-Profile"></a>
###Travel Agent Profile

In order to book travel agent rates, track travel agent bookings and statistics, and allow for travel agent invoicing, you need to create and attach a travel agent profile to bookings.

To create the new travel agent profile, select the Profile icon and then select “Travel Agency Contracts.” This will take you to a list of travel agents who have been set up for your hotel. You can select any travel agent and update any additional details you may have such as IATA, contact person, address or notes with regards to the agency.

You can also create a new travel agent contract by selecting the button. Once this field opens, you will be asked to update the different details. One important field is the bill assignment field. If you manage this field correctly, when new bookings are made it will automatically assign the booking at the correct rate to the correct bill.

Note that most OTA (Online Travel Agents) already have profiles in Mews, and if you work with a Channel Manager, you need to select the profile from the listed TA profiles, rather than creating a new profile. The benefit of this is that the TA Profile is already mapped against all of the connected OTA's.

- **Customer Always**: When a new booking is created for this travel agent, it will leave the stay charge in the customer field, as the guest will be responsible for paying his bill himself.
- **Customer Always without Commission**: This option will discount the rate by the commission but still place the charge on the bill of the customer, who is due to pay for this charge.
- **Travel Agency Always**: This option will move the stay charge to the Travel Agent bill, so that the travel agent, rather than the customer, will have to pay for the rate.
- **Travel Agency Always without Commission**: This option will move the charge to the travel agent’s bill and will subtract the commission.
- **Travel Agency Only if Prepaid**: This option will move the bill to the travel agent only if it was pre-paid. If it was a BAR rate or another non-prepaid rate, it will leave the charge on the guest bill to be paid upon departure.

## Creating Reservations

https://vimeo.com/130024143

In order to make a new reservation, click the “New Reservation” button at the top of the screen. This button is visible from anywhere in the system allowing for quick and instant reservations.

Pressing the button will open a calendar on top of the timeline.

**Step 1 - Dates**

- Select Arrival Date
- Select Departure Date. The moment you have selected the departure date, the calendar will close, but still display the selected dates at the top of the screen. If you would like to change the selected dates, simply click on the dates to reopen the calendar.

**Step 2 - Options**

- Origin: how did the booking come in, this will help the management of the hotel analyse the sources of business. If you do not select an origin, you cannot proceed to the next step. If you select "Company" or "Travel Agent" you will be asked which company to TA is linked to the booking, and those fields are obligatory in order to track the production per company.
- Segment: Next you are asked to select the Business Segement of the booking. This again helps management analyse the origin of business. Management of the hotel can set up custom business segmentation for their hotel in the configuration of the system.
- Products: lastly, you are asked to select the products that you would like to have included into the booking. These could be items that you sell together with the room such as Breakfast, Baby Cots, Welcome VIP setups, etc. When you hover over the item you can see the cost of each item.

**Step 3 - Pricing**

- If you are working at a hostel, there is a quick switch at the top of this screen that allows you to see "beds" or "rooms/dorms".
- The first column shows the room types you have at the hotel
- The second column shows how many rooms you have available in the selected stay period.
- Rooms: If you would like to book more than 1 room, you can amend the number in this selection next to the room type. This is a quick tool to book larger groups.
- Adults / Children: how many adults or children will you accommodate in the room. It only allows you to select up to the maximum number of people in a room, so the screen will tell you how many people fit in a room. It will not allow selections of more people.
- Rate Groups: the rates it displays next to the initial columns are according to the different rate groups. A rate group is a group of rates that have the same cancellation conditions, so we merge these together in 1 column and display the lowest available rate in that selection. This ensures you always offer the lowest available price to customers. When you hover over the currency name (ie. EUR) it will tell you which exact rate is behind the selection. If you would like to book a custom rate, you can simply override the rate provided in this screen and it will allow you to book the custom rate. Select the + sign to select a specific rate, and add it to your shopping basket

**Step 4 - Finish Booking**

- Select the customer by tying the last name, the first search result is always to create a new profile with a customer that has the same last name. Below the first search result we display all other options of customers in the system with the same name. Once a profile is selected, you can click on the word "customer" to open the guest profile and see his/her details and history.
- State: here you can select whether you would like to book a Definite booking (confirmed) or an Optional booking. If you select the "optional" state, you will be asked which release date you would like to offer on this booking. If the booking is not confirmed by the release date, it will appear on the dashboard in red as a booking that passed its option, and needs to be resolved.
- Confirmation: you can select whether you would like to "send" or "not send" a confirmation. If you would like to send it to a "custom e-mail" if someone else books for the guest (like for example a secretary booking for her boss), in that case it will send the confirmation directly to the secretary.
- Notes: if you have any specific booking notes, you can add them here and they will print on all reports.
- Create: when all selections are made, you can press the button "create" and it will complete the booking and take you straight to the completed booking.

<a name="Booking-Management"></a>
##Booking Management

In order to manage an existing reservation, you need to find the booking first. There are a few methods to quickly find a booking:

- The quickest way is to type the guest name/e-mail/confirmation number/room number in the search box at the top menu. Once you select the customer, you will be redirected to the Customer Dashboard where you have an overview of all future bookings of this client. Please select “Manage Booking.”
- You can select a booking directly on the timeline. The booking details will appear from the right. Please select “Manage” to open the “Manage Booking” screen.
- From the reservation overview or reservation report, you can find a booking based on different filters. The bookings are selectable and once you open the booking, press “Manage Booking.”

The Booking Management screen consists of 2 sides, left and right. The right hand side contains the booking information. If you have a group booking you will see multiple names on the right, you can click on each name to open up the details about each booking. Next to each name you have an icon of a puppet, which will take you straight into the guest profile, and the second icon is a dollar sign, which will take you into the billing screen of the guest.

On the top bar you have several buttons:
- Lock All or Unlock All: this will lock all the bookings on the timeline, so that no one can move the bookings, unless they unlock them again.
- Select All or Deselect All: if you have multiple bookings in the reservation, you can quickly click this button to select or deselect all the bookings
- Open All: this will open up the booking details of each individual reservation in this group.
- Close All: this will close all the booking details of the individuals bookings

 <a name="Guide-State"></a>
###State
In the State screen you are able to manage the status of the reservation. The system knows the following statuses:

- **Optional**: The booking is not yet confirmed but is blocking space on the timeline and availability. No revenue, however, is yet recorded in revenue reports. If options are cancelled, no cancellation fees will be incurred. All optional bookings have a release date assigned, and on the date of release, it will highlight the bookings in the reservation overview/report to decide whether to extend the option or release. Note that the system will not automatically release bookings.
- **Confirmed**: Bookings that are confirmed will display on the timeline and have revenue assigned. If cancelled they may be liable for cancellation fees, depending on the rate type selected.
- **Cancelled**: If a booking is cancelled, it will be removed from the timeline, and cancellation conditions will decide whether it should incur charges. It will open the availability (via sales efforts) for that one room to be booked.
- **Checked-out**: All bookings that have completed their stay will have the status "Checked-Out". Once a booking is checked-out, you can no longer check it back in.
- **Checked-in**: A booking that is currently in-house will be considered "Checked-In"

From the **State** tab you will be able to manage the different statuses.

- **Customer Balance**: At the top of the State screen, you can see the customer balances of all customers assigned to the group and selected (by the tick box next to bookings). You can select "Payments" to add preauthorization or prepayments to the booking. Alternatively you can enter the "Billing" screen where you can take payments or settle bills. If the "billing" button is blue, that means that there is action required, as there are still open bills that require to be closed. So even if the balance is set to 0, and the button is blue, that means that the bill is not yet closed. If you are handling a group booking and have selected multiple bookings in the group, you will see the Customer Balance of all participants, allowing you to quickly see the balance of the whole group.
- **Room Assignment**: You will see all the bookings that are in the group and selected. Here you can quickly see the housekeeping status of the room currently assigned, and you can either assign another inspected room or inspect the room directly in the system (if you have the ok from your housekeeper). It only displays rooms in the same category, organized by room number, and it will not allow you to assign a room that has another "locked" reservation on it.
If the "Room Criteria" have been set up, you can instantly see the key features of the different rooms, next to the room number to help reception assign the correct room to the right customer.
https://vimeo.com/115251453
Similar to the Customer Balance if you have a group booking and you select multiple bookings you can do the room assignment for multiple rooms at the same time.
- **Confirm**: If a booking is on OPTIONAL state, you can confirm bookings directly from this screen. It will change the status to "Confirmed" and post the revenue on the customer bill. Next to the confirmation box you are also able to send a confirmation to another person who is not assigned to the booking. Type the e-mail in the box and he/she will receive the confirmation e-mail with a summary of all the bookings that are selected.
- **Check-in**: Once you have assigned an inspected room, you can select the button “Check-In.” Note that the check-in button will only appear if you have selected a booking(s) that is on arrival today. It will check in all bookings that were selected, allowing you to check-in multiple bookings at the same time. If a booking is due to arrive today, there is also a "print" button next to it, allowing you to instantly print the registration card of the guest, if your country still requires physical signatures on the registration cards.
- **Check-out**: On the day of departure for the booking(s) selected, a new button will appear called "Check-Out.” The system will only allow you to check-out a guest for whom all open bills and unsettled items have been paid with a balance on zero. Should you wish to check-out a customer with an open balance (as he may pay it later), select the "Check-Out with Open Bill" and fill in the reason. This room will then be transferred to the Guest Ledger report in red, where the payment will need to be resolved as soon as possible.
- **Cancellation**: If you wish to cancel a booking, you are asked to provide a reason from a selection of reasons. It is important to select the correct reason, so that management can analyse the reasons and see if there is a key reason for cancellation, to try and prevent this. You can also describe it in the open-text-field. See below a list of the cancellation reasons with a short description if needed:
 - BookedElsewhere: if the guest has booked another hotel or destination
 - CancelledByAgent: if the agent calls and does not provide a further reason
 - ConfirmationMissed: if the customer has an optional booking, but did not confirm on the release date
 - ForceMajeure: if the guest had to cancel his stay due to a force majeure event, such as earthquakes, floods, etc.
 - GuestComplaint: if the guest complains, and wants to cancel their order
 - InputError: if the booking was input by error
 - InvalidPayment: if the payment details provided by the guest were not valid
 - NoShow: if the guest did not show up for his accommodation
 - Other: If none of these reasons describe the reason, then specify it further in the open-text-field
 - PriceTooHigh: if the guest cancels his stay due to the high price
 - ServiceNotAvailable: if you are for example fully booked and you have to cancel the booking, this is because the "service is not available"

Secondly, you need to decide whether you would like to charge cancellation fees or not. The system knows the cancellation conditions on each rate type, and it will charge them accordingly, for example:

--> Fully Flexible / BAR: If you set a rate with a cancellation condition to allow cancellations up to 24 hours prior to arrival (24 hours prior to the official check-in time set in the system) and you cancel a booking within the 24 hours, it will automatically post the cancellation charge (at 0% VAT) and remove the stay charges.

--> You should only close bills on the day of check-out, because if you close a bill before check-out and try to shorten the reservation or cancel it, the system will attempt to correct the charges on the closed bill (as they were posted at the wrong VAT level). This may result in new charges (cancellation charges) being posted on the bill.

--> If you try to cancel a bill "Without Fee” but have already closed the bill, then the system will post refunds automatically on the bill.

 <a name="Guide-Properties"></a>
###Properties

- **Arrival&Departure Dates**: Select the reservations you wish to amend. Note that if you select multiple bookings with the same arrival and departure dates, the system will prefill the date fields with the correct dates. If you select bookings with different dates, it will not be able to prefill these fields.
If you are extending a booking with additional nights, there is no need to tick the box "Cancel without Fee" as this button is not applicable for extensions.
If you are shortening or extending a booking and do not tick the box "Keep Old Price," it will review if the prices have changed since you made the booking and re-price them.
When you shorten a booking, you need to decide whether you would like to charge cancellation fees. If you do, leave the box "Cancel without Fee" un-ticked.
- **Business Segment**: You can select whether the Business Segment of the booking. The hotel can set up different business segments themselves in the configuration (under the rates section in "services").
- **Origin**: Select the source of business.
 - AgencyDirect: For travel agent bookings
 - CompanyDirect: For company bookings
 - E-mail: Direct booking via e-mail to the hotel
 - Fax
 - InPerson: If a person comes to the reception and makes a future booking.
 - PhoneCall
 - WalkIn: If a person comes to the reception and makes a booking for the same night.
 - Website: Booking through the website.
- **Room Category**: If you would like to change the booked room category to a higher or lower category in the system, you can select the new room category here. When you make this change, you need to decide whether you would like to keep the old price or whether you would like the system to re-price it against the pricing set in the system (for those specific dates and the new room type).
- **Person Count**: If the occupancy of the room has changed, you can select here the new number of people occupying the room. If you tick the box "Keep Old Price," it will keep the base price the same. Please note that the only thing the system will add or subtract is the cost of the per-person-per-night items within the booking (such as breakfast cost).
- **Company**: If you wish to add an existing company to a booking, this will allow you to track the company production in reports. It also opens up the possibility in billing to open a bill to the company name/address.
- **Travel Agent**: If you wish to add an existing travel agent to the booking, this will allow you to track the travel agent production in reports. It also opens up the possibility in the billing to open a bill to the travel agent/address.
- **Notes**: If you wish to add or update the notes on a bill, select the bookings for which you wish to update the names and the current note will appear for you to amend. (Please note that if you select multiple bookings and the existing notes are different, it will not be able to display any notes. The “Notes” box will be empty.)

<a name="Guide-Group"></a>
###Group

- **Group Name**: Assign a group name to the booking, enabling you to quickly (through the search box) find all bookings related to the group name. Each booking is automatically assigned a group name which is constructed from the arrival date and the guest name. Note that group names should not contain spaces, allowing you to search for groups via the search box.
- **Merge Group into this one**: If you wish to add reservations to an existing group, you can use this option.
 - Step 1: Make the additional bookings manually.
 - Step 2: Assign the new booking(s) the same group name.
 - Step 3: Merge the groups.
- **Add an existing customer**: If you would like to manage the customers staying in the physical room, you can assign a customer with an existing customer profile. Type his name to find the profile and add it to the booking.
- **Add a new customer**: If the customer you are trying to add to the booking does not have an existing profile in the system, you can quickly generate a new profile. The only required detail is the last name of the customer.
Once you have added a customer to the booking, in the booking details you will see a list of all customers assigned to the booking. You have to always ensure that 1 customer is made the owner of the booking because this will ensure that there is 1 main person displayed on the timeline and in the arrivals report. For example, if a room is booked for 2 persons, and you are trying to assign a 3rd person to this room, the system will not allow it. You have to press the "<" arrow to move 1 person out of the booking into the list of "Unassigned Companions.”

Note that all persons assigned to the group (even if they are in the "unassigned companions" section) will be connected, and if you enter the bill of one of the group members, you will be able to see all items on the group bill for all companions of the group.
To remove a member from a group, press the "X" next to their name, and they will be removed from the group and group-billing details.

<a name="Guide-Pricing"></a>
###Pricing

- **Rate**: When you select this box, it will offer you all available rate types in the system, and you can change the rate type (which will impact the cancellation conditions on the booking). It will also automatically recalculate the value of the booking based on the new rate type assigned. If you wish to keep the same rate, tick the box "Keep Old Rate"
- **Set Average Night Cost**: If you wish to amend the average night rate, type the new value and select the currency. All rate changes require a reason to be completed in order to notify management of the change.
- **Percentual Discount**: To give a percentual discount, type the discount percentage and complete the reason for the discount.
- **Per Night Pricing**: First select the currency of the rate. Secondly for each night of the accommodation you can set a custom price that you have negotiated. In the last box, provide a reason for the reprice. Note that you cannot set a price that is negative. If you set the price to a value below the value of the products, it will set the value of the products (such as breakfast, etc) to 0.

<a name="Guide-Items"></a>
###Items

In this tab you will see a list of all the items that have been ordered by or for the guest related to the booking. First you will see the accommodation nights. Secondly you will see a list of product orders (such as breakfast, parking, etc.). You can select each posted product to see more details about the creator, time of creation, etc. If the product has not yet been consumed, you will still be able to cancel the item from the bill.

- **Nights**: You can quickly see each accommodation night and its value. But more importantly you can see on whose bill the accommodation was posted, so when you move the accommodation to someone elses bill, this is a quick way to find out where it was moved to.
- **Additional Expenses**: When the booking is cancelled and you post cancellation fees, you can quickly see that in this overview
- **Product Orders**: an overview of all the products that are linked to the accommodation part of the booking (such as city tax, breakfast, etc). If you are handling a future stay, you are able to quickly cancel products from the booking, by pressing "cancel".
- **Add Product**: if you made a booking and you forgot to include a product (such as city tax/breakast) you can quickly select the product and add it. Note that when you add a product, it will increase the total price of the accommodation.
- **Deposit**: this is a feature that is specifically for hotels that operate in a country where tax is paid when money is received, not when revenue is consumed (for example Czech Republic). This feature allows for a correct taxaction of the revenue. For example:
1. A non-refundable booking is made for next month
2. You take payment today (as its non-refundable), which means you should pay VAT also today. However as teh revenue is only posted next month, we have built a 3rd step.
3. You select the deposit option, which allows you to post a deposit (revenue correction). You can select the amount you would like to post, and the currency and VAT. Once posted, the system posts 1 revevenue item called "deposit" which should be closed against the payment you received today, allowing you to close the bill of these 2 items. The system will also post a second "deposit" item (with a consumption date, one month from today) which will balance out the future accommodation revenue and set the bill balance to 0, this bill should be closed on the day of departure.

<a name="Guide-Mailing"></a>
###Mailing

To send a confirmation by e-mail, you have 2 options

1. If the customer has an e-mail address on his personal profile, then simply press "OK," and the system will resend the confirmation e-mail to the customer.
2. If the customer asked to have the confirmation sent to another person, then in the "Custom E-mail" field you can complete the information of the customer to whom you wish the send the confirmation and press "OK."

<a name="Action Log"></a>
###Action Log

The event log is an overview of all changes made to a booking since its creation. It provides details about the person, time, date and specific change.

<a name="Guide-Timeline"></a>
##Timeline

The timeline is the graphical display of all bookings in a selected time period, organized primarily by room type and secondly by room number within that room type.

Bookings are automatically allotted to rooms on the timeline. In the (accommodation options) configuration of the hotel you can decide whether you would like bookings to be assigned from the top-down, bottom-up or randomly.

If the hotel has made more bookings than the number of rooms available in the category, the system will automatically create a "dummy room" in which it will place the reservation until the hotel has resolved this room type overbooking. You can resolve the overbooking by moving the booking from the dummy room to another available slot (maybe in a higher or lower room category). Once you have moved the booking out of the dummy room, the system will automatically remove the room from the timeline. Note that you cannot manually place bookings into the dummy rooms, as the system is designed to try to close these "fake" rooms as soon as possible, so the only way to close them is by moving bookings out of the red allocations.

You have the ability to zoom in and out of the entire timeline, which can be done not only to display a large amount of bookings at the same time, but also to optimize usage on mobile devices.

<a name="Room-Numbers"></a>
###Room Numbers

The numbers on the left of the timeline can be selected, and a flow will open up with details of the status of the room. From this screen you will quickly be able to change the status of the room to dirty/clean/inspected/out of service and out of order.

<a name="House-Use"></a>
###House Use

On the timeline you will find the button to create a "House Use Booking.” House Use should be used for reservations for staff members and people doing work for the hotel. It will block the room from sales, but will not impact the Average Rate and Occupancy Rates, as the room is used for internal purposes.

Note that people who are booked on House Use will not appear in reservation and breakfast reports.

<a name="Guide-Bookings"></a>
###Bookings

Bookings appear as blocks on the timeline and block a period on the timeline in line with the length of the booking. Each booking has the name of the main contact on the booking (last name first).

Note that the timeline shows the arrival and departure time. So for example if the departure of a booking is later than 3 PM, but there is another arrival for that same room at 2 PM on the same day, the system will try to reallocate the arrival room automatically.

Selecting one of the bookings on the timeline will open a screen from the right with basic details (rate, arrival, departure, etc.). From this screen you can select the “Manage” button to open the reservation management screen, fully described in the "Managing Existing Booking" section.

Clicking on the Guest Name will take you to the guest profile from where you can maintain the customer details.  

<a name="Locking-Rooms"></a>
###Locking rooms on the timeline

When you select a booking on the timeline, the booking information will appear on the right, here you will see a small icon of a lock. Pressing the lock will lock the reservation in the room number selected. The booking can no longer be moved. It may be that the guest specifically requested this room or a room with a specific view. Locking a room will prevent others from moving the room into a different room number, ensuring happy guests.

<a name="Moving-Rooms-Timeline"></a>
###Moving bookings across the timeline

Selecting and holding a booking on the timeline will allow you to drag the booking into another room number.

You will also easily be able to update a room to a higher room category. Once you have dragged-and-dropped a booking into a higher category, a icon of an upward arrow will appear on the booking in the timeline, highlighting that this was one of the upgraded bookings. If the booking is not locked in the upgraded room, the system may try to move it back down to the originally booked room-type in order to optimize revenues. If you wish to lock the room in the higher category, it is recommended you visit the "manage booking" screen where you can change the room category.

The timeline will not allow downgrades of a room to a lower category. This will help prevent accidental downgrades. If you do wish to downgrade a room, you need to enter the “Manage Booking” screen where you can override the room-type.

An important feature is dropping bookings on top of each other. The system will not allow 2 bookings to be accommodated in the same room, so when you top a booking on top of another one, (if the existing booking is not locked) it will try to reassign the existing booking in that slot, to a new room automatically, if it cannit find another suitable room, it will place the booking in an overbooking slot (red room allocation). Once a booking is placed into the overbooking slot, they will have to be moved manualy by someone in the hotel to a better suitable room allocation.

<a name="Colours-Timeline"></a>
###Colours used on the timeline

- **Blue Bookings**: Reservations that require action today. They are either bookings that need to be checked in or checked out within today.
- **Black Bookings**: Reservations that are currently in the hotel and do not require any action within today. They are already checked in and have a check-out date that is on a date later than today.
- **Grey Bookings**: Bookings that are either in the past or future and do not overlap with today, thus not requiring any action within today. Also House Use bookings are indicated in grey.
- **Yellow Bookings**: Bookings that are indicating Out Of Order rooms. Once a room is placed out of order, it is no longer available for sale.

- **Black Room Numbers**: Inspected room
- **Orange Room Numbers**: Dirty room
- **Blue Room Number**: Clean room
- **Grey Room Number**: Out of Service Room

<a name="Check-in"></a>
##Check-in

To check-in, the first step is identifying the room to be checked in. There are a few methods to quickly find a booking:

- The quickest is to type the guest name/e-mail/confirmation in the search box at the top menu. Once you select the customer, you will be redirected to the Customer Dashboard where you get an overview of all future bookings of this client.
- You can select a booking directly on the timeline. The booking details will appear from the right. Please select “Manage” to open the “Manage Booking’ screen.
- From the reservation overview or reservation report, you can find a booking based on a different filter. The bookings are selectable, and once you open the booking, press “Manage Booking.”

Once you have identified the booking, select the “Check In” button on the booking screen. This button only appears on the day of arrival. It will open the "Booking Management" screen in the tab "State" where you can perform the following steps.

1. Verify all booking details with the customer, which includes the arrival and departure date, room-type, rate and number of people. Also inform the guest whether the booking was prepaid or not. Once verified, check with the guest how he/she would like to guarantee payment for the booking and any possible incidental charges.
2. Take preauthorization or deposit from the guest for the amount agreed. Once the money has been accepted, process this in the system by selecting either the “Preauthorization” or “Deposit” button, which will allow you to post the amount directly in the system.
3. Check that the pre-assigned room is inspected. If it is not, check if there is another room of the same type that is available and inspected. This can be spotted quickly from the dropdown menu. If no room is available ensure you assign an available (dirty or clean) room and contact housekeeping to get the room cleaned.
4. Once an inspected room is assigned, you can press “Check-in,” and the room is checked in. It will be locked, so that it cannot be moved in the system.

Checking in a continuing reservation can be quite challenging.
- First, you will want to ensure that the same room number has been allocated for the continuing booking, so that the guest will not be required to move. Ensure that this is done at the booking stage, as it may be harder to move bookings around on the day of arrival. Always lock your booking, so that no one can move the room.
- Check-out the current booking. The booking that is currently checked-in will have to be checked out. You can check it out by ticking the box "Check Out with Open Balance,” and it will leave the charges unpaid on the guest profile.
- Lastly, you can check in the new reservation, and once this is done, you will see that all the charges from the first booking are automatically transferred to this bill.

<a name="Check-out"></a>
##Check-out

To check-out, the first step is identifying the booking to be checked out. There are a few methods to quickly find a booking:

- The quickest way is to type the guest name/e-mail/confirmation/room number/e-mail in the search box at the top menu. Once you select the customer you will be redirected to the Customer Dashboard where you get an overview of all future bookings of this client.
- You can select a booking directly on the timeline. The booking details will appear from the right. Please select “Manage” to open the “Manage Booking” screen.
- From the reservation overview or reservation report, you can find a booking based on a different filter. The bookings are selectable, and once you open the booking, press “Manage Booking.”

Once you have identified the booking, select the “Check Out” button on the booking screen. This button only appears on the booking on the day of departure.

<a name="Review-Customer-Balance"></a>
###Review Customer Balance

If the balance is zero, you can immediately check-out the reservation by clicking the “Check Out” button, and the customer is ready to leave. If the balance is not zero, click on the billing button, and you will be taken to the payment screen. To understand how to settle the balance, please refer to the section “Payment Screen” in this manual. Once the balance is settled, you can return to the check-out screen and check the room out.

Note if you need to check out a guest even though they have not yet settled the bill (for example for a continueing booking) this is possible, Next to the "Check-out" button, simply click "Check-out with Open Bill", provide a reason, and the reservation will be checekd out. The bill will appear in the Guest Ledger, so that you can follow up on the payment.

Once the room is checked-out in the system, it will automatically turn "dirty" in the system so that housekeeping is informed that it requires cleaning.

<a name="The-Billing-Screen"></a>
###The Billing Screen

To access the billing screen, from the "state" tab in the booking management, you can instantly see the open balance, and next to it the button "Billing". If the button is blue, this means that action is required, either to close a balances bill, or to settle a bill.

<a name="Unpaid-Items"></a>
###Unpaid Items

All items that are posted on the customer’s bill are automatically routed into the “Unpaid Items” overview on the left hand side of the payment screen, unless specific routing instructions are inserted. As long as there are unpaid items on a customer profile, the system does not allow you to check a room out.

Should you need to add additional manual charges to the bill, you can select “New Item” in the billing screen. Select a service category, and within this category select the product, quantity, price, currency and any written notes that you wish to post. The correct VAT is automatically preselected.

Note that if the customer is part of a group, you will also see all of the other customers in that group along with their unsettled items. If you move items into the bill of one of the customers, they will disappear from the unsettled group-billing list. Be careful when you assign bill items from groups because it may be hard to find any items you accidently misplace (and you will have to inspect every single bill of the group’s companions to find it).

<a name="Open-Bills"></a>
###Open Bills

The open bill section (on the right of the payment screen) refers to the customer bills that need to be settled by the customer directly upon check-out. First, select the bill that you are looking to settle. Second, by selecting the arrow next to an “unpaid item” you can easily move it into the bill you are working in. At the top you can see the total unsettled amount. You can easily create a preview bill or pro-forma for a guest to show how the bill will print and with which address details. Allow the guest to always check this before checking them out. Once a bill is checked-out, you cannot re-open the bill to amend the address.

Once the customer has confirmed the charges and address details, ask the customer how he wishes to settle his account. Once agreed on a payment type, select “Payment” on the bill, and you can select from the different payment options that your hotel offers. By selecting one of the options, the system opens a new screen with an amount. This amount is the exact amount that is required to settle a bill in order to attain a zero balance. You can of course change this amount if you wish to do so. However in order to close a bill it has to be balanced to zero.

The moment the bill is set to a zero balance, a new button appears at the bottom of the bill you are working in called “Review and Close.” This allows you to review the bill once more, and in this screen you can still amend the address. Once you press “Close and Print,” the bill is closed, and the customer is checked out.

**Credit Note / Rebate**: if you have accidentally closed a bill with an incorrect item on it, you will have to rebate the original bill. To rebate a bill, you will have to open a new bill on the same customer profile, and create the same items as on the original bill, and post them with the opposite value. This corrects the initial bill. Once corrected, you close this bill, and you can repost them correctly. This is quite a lot of work, and its highly recommended to always print the bill-preview for guests to check their details prior to check-out, this might save you a lot of work.

<a name="Close-To-Invoice"></a>
####Close to Invoice

Hotels who have selected to enable the “Closing to Invoice” option will see a button on any bill that has a negative or positive balance. If there are items on the bill creating a balance, the button "Close to Invoice" will generate an invoice form where you will need to complete the invoice details. Once you create the invoice, it will post a payment type on the bill called "Invoice," and you will be able to close the bill.

<a name="Company-Bills"></a>
###Company Bills

Should a customer wish to check the bill out to a company address, this is possible. Go back into the customer profile and assign a company. Should the company not yet exist, create a new company profile first before selecting it.

Once a company is assigned, go back into the “Payment” screen, and you will see that next to “Company” a new button has appeared allowing you to open a company bill. Select this button, and it auto-opens a new bill. You can start moving unpaid items into this bill.

If you closed a bill, and you realize afterwards that you had to assign it to a company, this is possible (but only during the editable history window). Open the bill, and select "Assign to Company" and you can select the company to which you would like to change the address details.

<a name="Travel-Agent-Bills"></a>
###Travel Agent Bills

You are also able to assign items to a travel agent bill. To do this manually, move the items you wish to move into an open customer bill and select the button “Assign” which will allow you to assign them to a travel agent. Once selected, the system will ask you which travel agent you wish to route the charges to. Once selected, the items move automatically into the travel agent profile.

If you closed a bill, and you realize afterwards that you had to assign it to a travel agent, this is possible (but only during the editable history window). Open the bill, and select "Assign to Travel Agent" and you can select the travel agent to which you would like to change the address details.

<a name="Transferring-Items"></a>
###Transferring Items to Another Customer

Should you need to move billing items to another customer, move the items in the bill of the original customer. Once the items are in the bill, select "Assign" then select "Move Items to a Different Customer.” The system will prompt you to select the customer to whom you wish to move the items.

<a name="Cashier-Function"></a>
##Cashier Function

The admin of a hotel can assign a “cashier” to individual persons or to multiple persons. Once a user has a cashier set up on his profile, a new icon will appear at the top of his/her screen. Through the Cashier they have access to complete cash transactions in the system. All cash transactions are tracked since the cashier was first opened (after a closed shift) in chronological order.

In Cashiering there are 2 options:
- **New Transaction**: This will allow for cash to be recorded that is used for petty cash transaction, such as parking, buying flowers for guests, etc.

- **Currency Exchange**: This option also allows for currency exchange, but only for hotels that actually offer this service. From this screen, you can input the amount of money and the guest’s name, and the system will calculate the converted amount and commission.

The cashier also tracks all Cash transactions made in the system on guest bills. THe cashier will keep a full overview of all cash income (money coming in) and outcome (money given out) and it will always give a snapshot of the current balance, which should correspond to the actual real-life balance of the cashier. At the end of the shift you would select "close cashier" and the system will ask you to which balance you would like to return the cashier. When you close the shift, the cashier will print a report that also highlights the amount of money in the "cash drop" that needs to be handed over to the manager.

<a name="Room-Management"></a>
##Room Management

<a name="Housekeeping-Status"></a>
###Housekeeping Status

- **Dirty**: The room was vacated by the previous customer or has gone through a 1 night-run and is placed in the dirty status. This signifies to housekeeping that the room requires cleaning. Front office will not be allowed to check a customer into a room in this status.
- **Clean**: Once the housekeeper has cleaned the room, he/she should place the room in the "Clean" status, signifying to the floor supervisor that the room is cleaned and should be inspected prior to arrival. Front office will not be allowed to check a customer into a room in this status.
- **Inspected**: Once a supervisor or manager has inspected the room, it is placed in the system as "inspected," and front office is allowed to check a customer into this room.
- **Out Of Service**: Placing a room out of service means that there is a minor defect in the room that can be fixed before 18h00 in the evening on the same day. The room is not taken out of the sales inventory and will continue to be sold.
- **Out Of Order**: Placing a room out of order is a serious decision that should only ever be made by a supervisor. When you place a room out of order, it is taken out of the central inventory and will stop selling for the period that you have selected it to be out of order. You should always try to prevent using this status unless there is no other option.

To place a room out of order, select the room number via the timeline, and you will see a screen appear from the right. Select "Out Of Order," and the system will prompt you with the following questions:

- Reason: Always write down the reason, so that all of your colleagues know the reason behind the out of order status.
- Planned Out Of Order Start: Provide the date and time from which moment the room will be out of order.
- Planned Out Of Order End: Provide the date after which the room will come back into service. If you select the room maintenance to be finished on Thursday (to be sold on Friday), place its out of order finish date as Thursday, and it will be automatically released on Friday for sale.

<a name="Room-Status-Report"></a>
###Room Status Report

From the dashboard you can select the "Room Status" report, which gives a more detailed overview of today's performance. This report gives an overview of all room details, which are necessary for housekeeping to manage their department.

Note that this report has been fully optimized for mobile, allowing a housekeeper to run the report from his/her smartphone, providing all the details as mentioned below, allowing the HSK team ot manage their floor without requiring any reports/support, instantly being able to inspect rooms back into the system.

- Room Numbers
- Room Status (Clean, Dirty, Inspected, Out Of Service): You can instantly change the status from this screen. Each night after midnight the system automatically turns all occupied rooms to “Dirty”, but leaves the “Clean” and “Inspected” rooms on the same status. If a room is checked in or out from the system, it is also automatically turned to “Dirty.”
- The “Out Of Service” status should be used if you would like to temporarily block the room due to a small maintenance issue that can be fixed within that same day. Note that if you place a room “Out Of Service,” it does not impact the sales strategy, and the system will keep selling the room for that night. If the room is in a condition that does not allow it to be sold that night, you may want to place the room “Out Of Order.”
- Departure: You can see whether the room is on departure and which guest is accommodated in the room.
- Arrival: From this column you can see the name of the new arrival. If the name is displayed in between the 2 columns (departure  & arrival), this means that the same guest is staying overnight in the room for another night. In brackets behind the name, you can see how many nights the guests is staying, and what night (out of the total nights) the current date is.
- Heating Preset: If you have the heating module set up in your hotel, the system automatically pre-heats the room 3 hours prior to arrival. This is another reason why it is so important to always update the arrival time.
- Card in Lock: If you have the card reader system in the bedroom connected, you can quickly see whether a guest is currently in the room (when the card is in the lock reader). This will help housekeeping identify the vacant rooms to clean.
- Temperature: If you have the heating module set up, this will allow you to instantly see the exact temperature in the bedroom.

At the top of the report there are 3 filters you can select to narrow down the report:
- Floor
- State: if you would only like to see rooms in a specific housekeeping state (for example, the supervisor would only like ot see "clean" rooms which require inspection.
- Reservation: if you would like to select to see only specific types of reservations, such as arrivals only, or departures only.

<a name="Guide-Overbooking"></a>
###Overbooking

<a name="Room-Type-Overbooking"></a>
###Room Type Overbooking

A reservations system should always prevent room type overbookings, as it leaves guests unhappy, and it does not help revenue management efforts. With faster and more modern reservations systems, room type overbookings occur less and less. However due to allotment commitments and other agreements with partners, it will happen at times that you have to accept bookings when you are already fully booked on a room type.

Only staff members with supervisory rights are allowed to make bookings from the reservations screen when a hotel is fully booked. On the new reservation screen, once you have selected your preferred dates, it will tell you on the left how many rooms in that category are still available.

Once a booking is made that exceeds the number of rooms in a room category, the system will create a "dummy room" on the timeline in red and place the booking in it. It is then up to the hotel team to move some of the bookings around to close this overbooking.

<a name="Key-Reports"></a>
##Key Reports

Almost every report in Mews have date selection and/or time selection.
Dates only: when there is a date selection only and you select the end date (for example 30th April) this will include the full end date as selected
Dates & Times: when there is both a date and a time selection on the report,be careful as often users forget to include the last day. For example if you try to run a report for April, you need to select
 - Start date: 01 April at 00:00:00
 - End date: 1 May at 00:00:00 (not the 30th April 00:00:00 as this will not include the last day)

<a name="Reservation-Report"></a>
###Reservation Report

The reservation report provides all needed information about all the bookings at the hotel. The report has a large number of filters that allows for personalization of the report. As always the report can be exported into excel, offering more columns with more detailed information.

Below is an explanation of a few of the key filters and their purposes.

- **Include Tax**: the report standarly runs with Net Rates, but if you would like to include tax into the rates simply tick this box and run the report.
- **Load Balances**: Should you require the overview of all guests in-house and their outstanding balances, selecting this box prior to loading will load the total bill balance of all of the guests. Note that as it will need to check all guest bills, this will slow down the running of the report somewhat.
- **Mode**: You can filter the report by "detailed" reservations. It will show each individual reservation, and you can review the individual details of these bookings. Alternatively you can select only the "Totals," and the report will only give the totals of the selection made. It will not display the individual bookings in this section.
- **Group By**:
 - Business Segment: it will run the report by the business segmentation that is set up at the hotel level.
 - Confirmation State: if you would be interested to see whether booking in the report are Optional or Confirmed.
 - Creation Date: this will show the results of the report organized by the creation date of the bookings.
 - Credit Card: to quickly show whether guest profiles have a Adyen/Braintree card attached or not, this helps identify reservations where the credit card failed, so that your reservations department can follow up on alternative payment methods.
 - Customer Category: if you would like to sort the report by Customer Category. The customer category can be set up in the Customer Profile in the "Internals" section. Should you need to add or amend the customer categories, contact your Mews representative.
 - Customer Nationality: if you want to analyse the origin of your customers.
 - Mother Company: when you set up your partner companies, you can assign also "mother companies", which represent the "head office" this helps you to quickly pull out statistics for multiple companies in 1 line.
 - Group: to pull out all the different groups that have bookings in a selected period.
 - Travel Agency: It will break the report down by all different travel agents that have booked the hotel in the selected period.
 - Partner Company: If you have assigned companies to bookings, it will break down the report by the partner companies.
 - Rate: If you would like to analyse the performance of specific rate types, you can select this filter.
 - Voucher: If you have the Mews Distributor, you can filter the report by the different voucher codes used by customers to analyse the performance of these codes.
 - Room Type: To analyse the performance of specific room types, you can see exactly how many bookings are made for each individual room type.
 - Origin: To generate a specific overview of the source of business (from booking engine, channel, and manual).
- **Filter**: You can filter the report by the following filters.
 - Created: By the creation date of the booking.
 - Arrival: By the arrival date of the booking.
 - Departure: By the departure date of the booking.
 - In House: To review all bookings in house during a specific period. Note that the "in house" overview includes 2 tables, the top-most table shows all bookings that are precisely in the interval. The second table shows all bookings that touch the interval, so if some of those bookings arrived prior to the selected or departed after, they are also included.
 - Optional: To review all optional bookings.
 - Cancelled: To review all cancelled bookings by the **stay date**
 - Cancelled on: To review all cancelled bookings by the date **on which they were cancelled**
 - Confirmed on: to review when bookings were changed from Optional to Confirmed. This filter also includes all bookings that were booked as Confirmed.

Below is a description of a few of the Columns and their definitions.

- **Number**: This is the reservation number generated by the system and assigned to the booking. All guest confirmations are sent with this number, which can be searched directly in the search box.
- **Reservation Status**: This is displayed in an icon, in order to save space on the screen. The system has the following statuses:
 - Confirmed: The booking is a confirmed booking with a future arrival date.
 - Checked-in: The booking is currently in the hotel.
 - Checked-out: The booking is checked-out, and the customer is no longer in the hotel.
 - Holding: The reservation is not yet confirmed and still on optional status. When you hover over the question mark icon the release date will be displayed. Note that the system does not automatically release options. Instead, it highlights the bookings in the reservation overview/report once they have met or have passed the deadline.
- **Rate** and **Total Cost**: Note that the rate and total cost in this report are showing the rate inclusive of VAT and the products included in the rate (breakfast, city tax, halfboard, etc.).

Note that if you export the report into excel, the following additional columns are added to the report:
- Customer E-mail address
- Balance (of their bill)
- Creation date and the exact time
- Release date: if you have booked an optional booking
- Requested Room Type and Room Category: this allows you to compare whether the room type that was booked, also corresponds with the room type that was finally used to accommodate the guest.
- Reservations and Customer Notes

<a name="Reservation-Overview-Report"></a>
###Reservation Overview Report

The Reservation Overview Report is a quick snapshot of all bookings on Arrival, Departure, In House and Optional Bookings. It always shows the most up-to-date status of the remaining arrivals and departures to ensure that the front office at any time is able to check which guests are still requiring action.

If you select 1 day only, it will give a detailed overview of all the individual bookings. If you select multiple dates, you will get a chart view, highlighting all arrivals/departures/stayovers, which will help you plan shifts in housekeeping and front office.

At the top of the report you will see a link to print the registration cards that are arriving on this specific date. If you print registration cards from this report, we will prefill besides the customer details, also the arrival, departure, room number and travel agent.
Note: if there is no companion assigned to a booking, the registration card will print empty. So always ensure you have a guest assigned to the booking.

All bookings show:
- Button to take you directly to the “Manage Booking” screen
- Link to the booking on the timeline
- Link to the Customer Profile
- Link to the Housekeeping screen where you can change the cleaning status of this specific room
- Quick Link to print registration card of this booking
- Reservation and Customer Notes on the booking
- All companions on the booking

<a name="Customer-Statistics-Report"></a>
###Customer Statistics Report

The customer statistic report displays the countries where the hotel guests originate from and the amount of nights they have spent at the hotel. This information is important for the statistic offices, but may also be of interest in setting sales strategies for the hotel.

<a name="Guest-In-House-Report"></a>
###Guest In House Report

The Guest In House Report displays all guests in house at the time of running the report. The report is ordered by room numbers, starting at the lowest number and going upwards. For each room the report displays all the registered guests in the room and the products that are included (such as breakfast, halfboard, etc.). You can print the report with just this basic information, which can be used in the breakfast room to check the guest names against the room numbers.

**Credit Check** In addition to the above-mentioned items, it also shows the level of preauthorization taken by the reception on this account and a credit column. The credit column takes the preauthorization and subtracts all the unsettled bill items. If there is a negative balance, the number gets highlighted in red, as it requires action by reception in order to gain more credit on the account.

To contact the guests (with regards to the credit) you will find an additional column with the e-mail addresses of the customers.

<a name="Foreign-Police-Report"></a>
###Foreign Police Report

In some countries, it is still important to report all guest information to the foreign police daily. In order to collect this information, it is important to complete the Foreign Police Report daily with all the arrival guests. The report shows the percentage of completion on the dashboard and at the top of the report.

The report requires the following fields to be completed in order to achieve 100% completion:
- Customer
- Room
- Arrival
- Departure
- Customer Type
- Nationality
- Birth date
- Age
- Address
- Passport/ID number

If the Foreign Police allow it in the local country, Mews Systems is able to send the report extract automatically. The system will first send the report completion percentage to a manager 1 day after the arrival of guests, so that the hotel will have another 24 hours to finish mistakes and ensure 100% completion. After 24 hours the system sends the report automatically to the police.

<a name="Guest-Ledger-Report"></a>
###Guest Ledger Report

The Guest Ledger Report is an overview of all guest profiles with unpaid/unsettled balances on their accounts. A number of these guests still have future bookings, and thus are not seen as problematic. However if the account does not have any future bookings, but an outstanding unsettled amount, the account will be highlighted in red at the top of the report, showing the need for action.

**Date & Time Selection**: the selection of date/time, allows you to go back in time, and see the actual situation of the open balances at that time. This is important for accounting departments who run an end-of-month closure, and need to balance their books based on the opening balance and closeing balance of the Guest Ledger.

####4 Modes of the Guest Ledger

1. Customers: The overview is split up by all customers who have open balances on their accounts.
2. Accounting Categories: The overview is split according to the set accounting categories at the hotels to get a better understanding of the mix of revenue that is due.
3. Services: The overview is split according to the set services at the hotels to get a better understanding of the mix of revenue that is due.
4. Consumption Date: This filter breaks the report down from the oldest charge until the newest charge to get a better understanding of the expiration of bills and outstanding items.

####The Columns of the Guest Ledger

- **Consumed but not Billed - Revenue**: This column reflects the revenue items that have been consumed by customers, but are still on open bills of guests. These guests are not necessarily in-house, they could already have departed from the hotel (for example minibar items that are charged late to guest accounts).
- **Consumed but not Billed - Payments**: All payments that are posted in the system have an instant consumptions date/time. All items in this column are (similar to the revenue) on open bills of guests and require settlement.
- **Billed but not Consumed - Revenue**: This column reflects items that have not yet been consumed (such as a non-refundable accommodation night for a guest who is due to stay next month), but the hotel has already closed the bill prior to arrival. We recommend against closing bills prior to the departure date, as you are no longer able to change details of the booking once the bill is closed.
- **Billed but not Consumed - Payments**: This column should usually show 0, as all payments posted in the system have instant consumption, so this column should always remain 0.
- **Deposit Ledger**: giving an overview of all pre-payments, against which no consumed revenue has been posted yet, and thus is considered a "deposit".
- **Guest Ledger**: an overview of all Consumed Revenue for which payment has yet to be received.
- **General Ledger**: a final tally of both the Deposit and the Guest Ledgers, showing a total amount of revenue that is not covered by deposits in the system.

<a name="Financial-Transaction-Report"></a>
###Financial Transactions Report

The Financial Transactions Report gives an overview of all the payments and rebates made in the selected time period. The report is split in the following sections:

**Payments**

- Cash Payments: An overview of all cash payments taken in the selected time period. Note that not all payments are necessarily on closed bills, as some payments may be taken as deposits prior to the closure of the bill.
- Credit Card Payments Terminal: You can quickly identify all payments taken by the type of credit card and its receipt identifier. There is a filter at the top where you can select whether you would like to filter by credit card type. When it states "Terminal" this refers to external credit card terminals which are used for posting payments, once such a manual transaction is taken, the employee will need to manually post this transaction in the system as a "Terminal Payment".
- Credit Card Payments Gateway: if you have integrated a payment solution such as Adyen or Braintree, this section shows all transactions of payments that were taken directly through the system. Next to each transaction you can see the unique identifier provided by the payment integration and also whether the transaction has been "settled" (the bank has processed the payment) or unsettled (the bank is still processing the payment).
- External Payments: An overview of all external payments made. This could include bank transfers, exchange rate differences or invoice payments.
- New Complimentary Payment: This is the complimentary hotel account which shows where transactions may be closed that were offered to clients on complimentary basis.
- Exchange Rate Difference: The overview of payments in which there was an exchange rate difference between the time an item was posted and paid.

**Rebates**
As part of the report, you see a column, which is highlighting the "rebates", which is important to track for accounting, who needs to approve all rebates given. There is a great filter at the top of the report, where you can quickly filter out the rebates only.

Note: It is recommended that each person posting payments, prints the report at the end of his shift by filtering his/her name. They need to ensure they have the proper backup, receipts and bill copies for each single payment taken. These should be crosschecked and countersigned by another team member. Once complete, we recommend these be handed over to the accounting department.

<a name="Accounting-Report"></a>
###Accounting Report

The Accounting Report provides a full overview of all the revenues posted, divided by revenue group, in order to analyse the income. See below a short breakdown of all the possible filtering options:

**Modes**
- Grouped: see all revenues grouped
- Detailed: see each individual revenue item as an individual item

**Type**
- Billed: This filter will show all the billed revenue that has been processed in the selected time period. So if a bill was closed in that period, it will be included.
- Consumed: This filter will show all the consumed revenue that has been processed in the selected time period. So if an item was consumed in that period, it will be included. These could be items that are still on open bills.

**Group By**
- Accounting Category: if your accountant has set up Accounting Categories, this filter will group the different services/products within their selected accounting categories.
- Bill: if you want to see a breakdown by customer/bill
- Service: this will breakdown the report by the services that have been posted, with the individual products as sub parts of each service.
- VAT Rate: if you would like to see the report filtered by the different VAT rates.

Most accounting systems are able to import the Accounting Report Excel Extract into their system, to help track and record revenue and open invoices. When you select "Export to Excel" accountants can easily see all the revenue according to the filters selected, make necessary corrections, and then import it directly into the accounting program used.

<a name="Bills-and-Invoices-Report"></a>
###Bills & Invoices Report

The Bills and Invoices Report is a chronological overview of all bills ordered by bill numbers (lowest to highest). This will help find a bill after departure, should you need to reprint or review it. If you have a bill number, at the top of the screen there is a search box, which helps identify bills quicker. Alternatively you can select a specific period during which the bill was closed to narrow down the search.

The top of the report shows the "Invoices".
When a bill is closed to "invoice" the issuer is able to set a payment date, so that you can track whether an invoice was settled or not. When it is overdue, it will get an orange-tag highlighting that payment is late.
If you would like to see the balances of all bills/invoices, select the "load values" at the top of the report, and it will add a column with all balances. You could then filter it down further, if you would like to see the unpaid balances of 1 specific travel agent or company.

<a name="Manager-Report"></a>
###Manager Report

The Manager Report is the master summary used by management to analyse the performance of the day before, month-to-date and year-to-date performances of the hotel.

The report opens up with all revenues excluding taxes. If you wish to include the taxes, tick the box "Include Tax," and run the report again.

First, it will provide an overview of the available number of rooms/beds, out of order rooms and the occupancy.
Note that if a room is placed out of order, it will deduct this from the available number of rooms in order to calculate the occupancy percentage correctly.

Secondly, it breaks down the room revenue (exclusive of products such as breakfast, halfboard, etc.). This data will be used to calculate the following sub-data:
- Room Revenue Per Available Room (REVPAR) = The total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms (total rooms minus OOO rooms).
- Room Revenue Per Available Bed (REVPAB) = The total room revenue divided by the total number of available beds (total beds minus OOO beds).
- Average Daily Rate = The total room revenue divided by the total number of occupied rooms.
- Room Revenue Per Person = The total room revenue divided by the total number of guests staying overnight.

Below the room revenue, you will also see a breakdown of the Cancellations, Refunds, other package items and all other services/accounting categories split per service with the revenue generated in that category.

Below the Total Revenues, you will also see all the Occupancy and Room Revenue numbers split per room type.

Note: if you have set up Accounting Categories, it will pull the report according to the accounting categories. If you do not have these set up, it will run according to the Services set up at the hotel.

<a name="Posting-Journal"></a>
###Posting Journal

The posting journal is an overview of all products that are posted in a selected time period. This is a great way for the accountant to check item-by-item is the postings are done correctly. Its also a great report to review all "rebates" done by employees in the hotel and the reasons that were provided.

<a name="Action-Log"></a>
###Action Log

The Action Log is an overview of all major events/actions/changes made to bookings and profiles in the system.

1. Worker: If you are investigating a specific person and his actions in the system, you can select the user in the selection field, and it will identify all system-events in the requested time period.
2. Event Type: In the Action Type you can narrow down the search to "Reservation Changes", "Service Orders" or "Price Adjustments.”
3. Reservation Change Type: If you selected "Reservation Changes" in the previous field, you can narrow down here the specific reservation changes you would like to review in more detail.

<a name="Spent-Nights-Report"></a>
###Spent Nights Report

The Spent Nights Report is an overview of how many guests stayed at the hotel on a specific date. This may be important for statistical purposes. You will be able to filter the report also by different sub-reports, depending on your country. For example, if you are in Prague, you can filter by "Prague City Tax", and the report will only show "leisure guests" in the required age group so that the hotel can use this to settle the monthly city tax.

<a name="Activity-Report"></a>
###Activity Report

The activity report is a great tool to analyse the operations of the hotel. Its a graphical display, by day-of-week and by the hours in those days, to help analyse where you have operational busy hotspots. We track check-in/out, housekeeping and booking creation.

When you select a specific activity, you also get an overview by employee of who are the most active
s in your team.

<a name="Occupancy-Report"></a>
###Occupancy Report

The Occupancy Report is a schematic overview of all room types, the number of rooms in each category and the business-on-the-books for each room-type per day. The overview offers insights into Occupancy, Average Daily Rate and Rooms Booked.

The report opens up with net rates (exclusive of VAT and exclusive of products such as breakfast). To include the VAT, tick the box at the top and run the report again. The report standardly opens a month period starting from today with end date 1 month later. You can run the report for any length of time. Note that the “Total” column will add up the business for the entire period, not per month.

When you export the report into Excel, it breaks down the results by room type, and all numbers are split in separate columns allowing easy manipulation and review of the numbers.

Through the usage of colour, you are quickly able to spot busy dates, which have a darker colour or overbookings, which are highlighted in red.

Below the occupancy charge, you will also see a chart that highlights the total available rooms per category per date.

<a name="Availability-Report"></a>
###Availability Report

The Availability Report is a schematic overview of all room types, the number of rooms in each category, and the rooms booked on each date by room type. Similar to the occupancy report it uses colors (dark=busys & light=quiet) to higlight when you have a lot of room booked.

When you have the Mews Distributor or the Channel Manager connected, these take the availability directly from this report. So if you would like to set overbooking or block rooms from sales, this is the best location to do so. To change the number of rooms for sale on 1 specific date/room type, click on the number, and it will give you the option to block or overbook. You also have the option to amend a larger period in 1 change.

Below the room availability, you also see the BAR rate that is sold for that room type on that day. From the filters at the top of the report you can select which Rate you would ike to see. To set up the default rate (the rate with which the report always opens first), ensure that in the rate settings of each individual rate, there is an "ordering" the rate with the lowest order number will display first in the report.

If you work at a hostel, at the top of the report, you have a quick switch to quickly view "beds" or "rooms".

<a name="Batch-Check-out"></a>
###Batch Check-out
If you operate a hotel with hundreds of rooms/beds, with a lot of group business, or if you work at a hostel. This report is very helpful in quickly identifying all people who are on departure today.

When you open the report, it shows 1 charts
1. All guests will 0 balance on their bills - you can instantly select "Check-out" and it will check out all guests at the same time, in 1 go.
2. Guests with balances: you will need to take payment for the outstanding amounts, before you are allowed to check these guests out.

<a name="Rate-Inclusion-Report"></a>
###Rate Inclusion Overview Report

The Rate Inclusion Overview is a chronological overview of the different package products that are included in the rate. This could be breakfast, halfboard, city tax, extra beds, etc. The report always shows the total number of customers in-house on a specific day and how many products were sold in each category.

For example, if the column "Breakfast" shows: 61/75, this means that 61 guests out of the total of 75 guests on that day have breakfast included in their rate.

This report can be used by the kitchen/restaurant to plan ahead for the amount of breakfast/lunches/dinners that are pre-booked. Alternatively housekeeping can use it to track the amount of extra beds that are booked.

<a name="Navigator"></a>
##Navigator

<a name="Messages"></a>
###Messages

Messages can be sent internally between employees. Besides employees, also guests who have downloaded the Navigator App, will be able to write the reception with requests directly. Messages come in both on the top-bar with a notification on the envelope icon, but also on the dashboard in the "messages" section.

Once you receive a message from a guest, all people who have "reception rights" will be notified. Once you open the messages section, you will see the unresolved message highlighted in blue (requiring action), once you have resolved the request, make sure you "resolve" the message by ticking the resolve-icon. Once resolved, the other employees will no longer see the message.

<a name="Orders"></a>
###Orders

Hotels who have the Mews Navigator installed, will be able to also load products for sale to the guests, which can be ordered directly from the smart-device of the customer. Order will come in as notifications on the top bad, and also in the section "orders" on the dashboard.

When you receive an order, they will appear in blue on the dashboard, to be resolved asap. To pick up the order, select the order, and check the details. From here you can:
1. process the order, which will post the item on the guest bill directly, and inform the guest that the order has been processed.
2. You can also comment on the order. Comments will be sent to the guest directly, so if you have specific questions about the order, this is the best way to ask the guest.

##Configuration

###Major Differences Versus Traditional Systems
####No Night Audit
One of the major changes we made is remove the night audit from the system, this has a few implications:
- **Accommodation charges**: these are traditionally posted during the night audit. Mews posts these charges at the time the booking is created/confirmed. So all future revenue is already recorded, but because its in the future, you can still amend it, change rates, cancel items, cancel bookings, etc.
- **No Shows**: you can set up an "editable history window" during which you can cancel or check-in no-shows or walk-ins after midnight. Once the editable history window expires, you will no longer be allowed to make changes to bookings, so its important that reception is aware, and these is a procedure in place for the handling of no-shows.
- **Reports**: traditionally as part of the night audit, the system spews out report after report. Mews however allows reports to be printed at any time, and they have a time filter on the report, so that you could run it between exact time periods. But in our philosofy the day changes at midnight, and revenue should fall in the day when its actually consumed, not when the PMS dictates it (due to night audit processes)

####Bills are linked to Guests not Rooms
In traditional PMS systems, bills are always linked to the rooms, in which guests are booked. So if you need to open a bill for a guest who is not staying in the hotel, you would have to open a thing called "paymaster" which is a dummy-room to which you can link the charged.
Mews however has linked all billing to Guest Profiles. So as long as there is a Guest Profile in the system, you are able to post charges against it, irrespective of whether or not there is a booking attached. Should you however post charges against a profile that does not have any booking linked to that profile, the Guest Profile will appear as "to be resolved" in the Guest Ledger. This will help you identify potential problematic accounts.

<a name="Main-Settings"></a>
###Main Settings

When you select settings in the menu bar at the top of the screen, and select your hotel name, this will take you to the main settings menu.

####General Settings
- **Identifier**: the code you see after the "identifier" field is your Unique Hotel ID. If you have a webdeveloper integrate the booking engine into your website, he will need this ID.
- **Name and Short Name**: Set the name of your hotel. This is the official hotel name (not the official company name). The short name is important for internal use only, so that it allows us to abbreviate it in reports and allows more columns on a page.
- **Description**: There is currently no direct function assigned to this, so there is no need to complete this field.
- **Unique Name**: Please always complete this field, which we used as part of the link we e-mail guests with their login to the online dashboard. Complete the field with the name of the hotel, preferably without spaces in lower case. (eg. waldorf-astoria)
- **E-mail**: Complete this field with the e-mail address from which you would like to communicate with guests.
- **Contact details**: Complete these fields with hotel telephone number, website address and physical address details, as this is important for the different types of communication sent through the system. Its best if you find your address using the provided Google Address bar, so that it will also pick up your Longitude and Lattitude, allowing us to place your hotel on a map with its exact coordinates.
- **Timezone**: you will not be able your Timezone, but its critically important that the correct timezone is selected, if you notice this is not the correct timezone, kindly contact Mews Support.

####Globalization
- **Supported Language**: This selection is not to set your personal language, but more to select in which language you want guest communication to be sent. Note that if you select languages, other than English, the hotel is responsible for the translations of the Confirmation E-mails, Registration Cards, Rate descriptions, Room Descriptions, Products and any other text that is guest-facing.

####Accounting
- **Accepted Currencies**: We allow the handling of multiple currencies, which allows you to accept money in a variety of currencies. You can set rates based on an automatic daily, monthly or yearly rate (note this is only available for countries in the EU currently). You can also select from which source you would like to take the exchange rate. The options are provided in the "Currency Rate Source" menu.
A hotel may also select to manage rates manually. In order to manage the exchange rate manually, you need to select "Never" in the Currency Rate Update menu and select "Exchange Rates" in the settings tab in the top-bar menu.
- **Bill Number Format**: Should you wish to have your bills/invoices to start with a prefix number, this is the field where you can set this value. Note that Bills&Invoices (currently) share the same line of numbering. In order to set up for example a starting number 2015 in front of your bills, you have to follow it by a placeholder, to let the system know how to format it. So it would be 2015{0:0000}
- **Invoice Number Format & Proforma Number Format**: please disregard these fields, as they are only applicable for a few hotels in Czech Republic.
- **Bill Header & Bill Footer**: Complete these fields with all official hotel details: address, official hotel name, VAT, bank details, etc. This will be used for Bills/Proformas/Invoices. Note that we print both Header and Footer at the top fo the bill, which is due to the design we have used, so the Footer will not be printed at the bottom of the page.
Unfortunately we cannot modify the design of the bill in any way, we have chosen this design to be valid across all hotels worldwide. When we start making exceptions it will increase the risk of bugs/misprinting, therefore we prefer to use 1 universal template.
- **Bill Closing**: You are provided with 3 options.
 - "Always Allowed" will allow you to close bills at any time, even if the items on the bill have not yet been consumed (for example a future stay).
 - "Only with Consumed Items" will allow you to only close bills that have consumed items on them, so if there is a future stay or transfer planned and pre-paid, it will not allow you to close this bill until the day of check-out. This setting is extremely restrictive to front desk, and we do not recommend using it.
 - "Only with Consumed Items in Half Day Window": this is probably the best setting to be used. Reason for this is that, the moment a bill is closed, you cannot always made changes to the booking, as items that are affected by the change are already on a closed bill. So if you do not allow bill closing until the day of departure, you ensure that you can still make changes to the booking until the day of departure.
- **Editable History**: The downside to not having a night audit, is that no-shows have to be resolved in some way before you run accounting reports, as the No-Show Accommodation Revenue needs to be converted into a Cancellation Revenue (we post revenue at the time of booking, so the system already posted the Accommodation Revenue at the time of booking). In general the system does not allow you to change historic bookings, as this has taken place, and the revenues/costs should be locked and unchangeable, so that the accountant can rely on the reports he/she receives. A hotel may decide to allow a period during which you can still make changes to bookings, move rooms and cancel bookings. We recommend not making this period last longer than 24 hours, but this is entirely up to the hotel's discretion. Do not give the accounting reports to the accountant until this period has elapsed, otherwise the accounting reports might still change.
To set up the field, you have to calculate from the Official Arrival Time of the hotel (for example 15:00), until the time you would like to allow employees to handle no-shows. So if you would like the editable history window to close at 8AM in the morning, you set it to 17 hours (from 15:00 until 08:00 the next day, total = 17 hours).
Note: often users will get error messages such as "you cannot make this change as the items on this reservation are on a closed bill", to still be able to fix errors such as this one, you could open up the Editable History Window, but make sure you inform the accountant when you do so, as it will impact his/her reports, as you are changing historic revenues.
- **Enabled External Payment Types**: we standardly equip your payment screen with Credit Card and Cash payment types. If you want to accept any additional payment types to settle guest bills, you can chose any of the following options:
 - BACS Payment (UK) - this is a bank transfer type that is used in the UK only.
 - Bad Debts - often if you have accounts open for long periods of time, the accounting department needs to write these off, so you could use this payment type to close accounts that are considered as "bad debt".
 - Barter - if you barter your hotel services against services of your customers. Closing bills to this payment type still allows you to track the revenue (rather than simply rebating it).
 - Complimentary - If your accountant wants to track the revenue of bookings that were provided on a "complimentary basis" this is one way to track it. Some accountants prefer to set the rate of the booking to 0, rather than generate articial revenue figures, other accountants would rebate the revenues, and another type of accountant prefers to close the bills to payment type "complimentary". This decision is entirely up to your accounting department.
 - Exchange Rate Difference - Our system has automated calculations of situations where exchange rate differences occur. Therefore we do not render it necessary to swich on this payment type, however some accountants still prefer to have this payment type, in order to close bills that could have exchange rate differences. Note: exchange rate differences occur in countries where the sales currency is different from the accounting currency (such as Czech Republic).
 - Exchange Rounding Difference: if you have a difference on a bill, often a minute amount, which is mostly due to the rounding of items, to close a bill with a 1 or 2 cent difference, you could use this payment type. This is very rate, and sometimes its easier to simply use "cash" rather than confuse the operations team with yet another payment type.
 - Invoice - We suggest not to switch on this external payment type, and rather provide the "Invoicing Tool" provided by the system, which allows invoice payment tracking. If you use this payment type, we will simply close a bill, with a payment against "invoice" however we will not ask for future due date, and the bill will still come out with the header "Bill".
 - Reseller Payment - This option is used in a similar manner to the Barter option, described earlier. Its up to your accountant to use this option.
 - Unspecified - if you receive payments in any other manner than the above described ways, you could use "unspecified". We often suggest using this if you have recently migrated from an old system to Mews, and the imported bookings were already paid, and thus you want to record this (rather than recording them double as CC payments).
 - Wire Transfer - This is another way of saying "Bank Transfer".

####Options
- **Closing Bill as Invoice**: This option allows you to close bills directly to invoices from the payment screen. As mentioned before in the "external payments this is the preferred method of closing invoices. When you close a Bill as Invoice, we will change the naming of the Bill to "Invoice", print the Due Date and leave the payment as "To be Paid".
- **Customer Invoice Module Enabled**: we recommend against using this module, as its a complete standalone invoicing module, which we wil ldiscontinue using in the near future. So any invoices created through this tool will no longer be supported in the future.
- **Invoice Payment Tracking Enabled**: if you have enabled the "Closing Bill as Invoice" option (above), then we would also recommend selecting this option, as it allows you to tack, in the "Bills and Invoices Report" they payments of outstanding invoices and their respective due dates.
- **Optional Credit Card Payment Details**: If you select this option in the settings, the system will not require the hotel to complete the receipt identifier details when posting manual credit card payments. This is preferred by some hotels in order to speed up check-out/in. Note this is only applicable for payments that are made on an external terminal and input manually in the system with a receipt from the terminal. If you make a payment via our Payment Gateway (Adyen/Braintree) we automatically record all details.
- **Send Confirmation E-mail Pre Checked**: If you select this option, when a new booking is input manually by one of the users via the "New Reservations Screen", the selection to send the Confirmation E-mail to the guest is pre-set to "send". If you do not tick it, the system will not automatically send confirmation e-mails to your guests, unless you specifically select this option during the booking process.

####Reception
- **Departure Time**: this field needs to denote your official departure time. The timeline is built on a 24hr basis, so bookings will appear on the timeline with their exact departure time, unless you manually change a booking to have a different departure time.
- **Arrival Time**: this field needs to denote your official arrival time. The timeline is built on a 24hr basis, so bookings will appear on the timeline with their exact arrival time, unless you manually change a booking to have a different arrival time.
- **Registration Card Text**: this HTML field can be used to input 2-3 sentences which can be added as T&C's to your registration card. Note there is limited space on the registration card, so when you are updating it, we would recommend to print the registration card while testing, to ensure part of the text is not cut off.
The size of the registration card is A5, so that you could pre-print the back of the card with your conditions.
We do not allow for modifications of the registration card, except for the Custom Text field. This allows us to ensure a consistent printing quality, and ensure pre-printed fields are filled correctly for every hotel.
- **LetShare URL**: if you have the Event Management System called "LetShare" integrated in your hotel, you could paste a link to this system here, so that we create a direct link on your dashboard, that allows switching between both systems seamlessly.

####Cleaning
- **Cleaning Interval**: this is the mimimum time required between room allocations, to allow housekeeping to clean a room.
For example if your guest asks for a late check-out until 14h00, and you have a booking arriving (with an offical arrival time of 14h30 in its booking) at 14h30 (and the cleaning interval is set to 1 hour) in that case, the system will try to allocate the new arrival to another room, as housekeeping will not have sufficient time to clean the room.
So in essence, this is helping improve your housekeeping planning.

####Distributor
- **Booking URL**: If the hotel is using the Mews Distributor on its homepage, complete this field with the URL of the hotel where the widget will be implemented. So that once the booking is completed, it will redirect the user back to the homescreen.
- **Booking Terms and Conditions URL**: For hotels who use the Mews Navigator on their website, in this field you can specify the terms and conditions of the hotel, which will display in the booking widget. It is critical to fill this field in with all of the hotel pricing and cancellation policies, as this is a key requirement of your payment provider (Adyen/Braintree) in order to get accepted by their compliance team.
Mews will automatically add its Data and Privacy Policies to your hotel policies, to explain guests about how their data will be stored and protected in the system.

- **Logo**: Upload a hotel logo in high quality JPEG. This logo will be printed on bills and other guest documents. It will also be loaded onto the dashboard.
- **Sign in Image**: upload the best photo you have of the hotel. This photo will be used as the background photo during the Online Registration/Check-in in the Mews Navigator.

####Import Customers
If you would like to import Company Profiles and Guest Bookings into Mews from your previous system, we have built a custom import module.

Download the excel template from this link. Once you open the Excel template you will see 2 tabs:
1. Companies: if you want to import Company Profiles, you can fill in the first tab with as many details you have of the companies. All columns are explained in the notes field in row 1 on each field. The minimum requirement is a Company Name, withouth which we cannot create an profile (logically)
2. Customers: if you want to create Customer Profiles, you can fill in all fields up to Internal Guest Notes. Importing a file with data completed in all fields up to the Internal Guest Notes, will result in an import and creation of Guest Profiles with all fields pre-filled. Note that as you are starting with a clean system, so be selective about the data that you import, in order not to pollute the system with data that is not up to date.
**Reservations Import** if you complete any columns in tab 2 from Arrival Date forward, we will also create the accompanying bookings, and link them to the Customer Profiles you just created.

**NOTE**: when filling in the file, you **MUST** follow the formatting as described in the notes field of each column. If there is any error the import will fail, and we will ask you to update it.

<a name="Exchange-Rates"></a>
###Exchange Rates

The Mews Commander supports multiple currencies, however rates need to be set in 1 base accounting currency. If you decide to set the exchange rate manually, you can do this in the "Exchange Rate" submenu. We recommend hotels change their exchange rate minimum 1 time yearly.

The Mews Commander works with a multi-currency environment, meaning that you can follow a different sales currency (or multiple sales currencies) that will at some point be converted to the local currency. If you regularly change the exchange rate, it will be more common that exchange rate differences occur. Mews Commander has automated the calculateion of exchange rate differences, and will post these automatically on bills, rather than relying on the Front Desk staff to post these manually.

<a name="Guide-Cashier"></a>
###Cashier
####Setting up the Cashiers
To set up the cashier for your hotel, there are 2 options:

1. The hotel may decide that all receptionists share 1 float of money. You can then assign multiple receptionists to 1 cashier in the system.
2. All receptionists may have their own float of money.  You can then only assign 1 receptionist to a cashier in the system.

To set up the cashier, select in the settings the "Cashier" button.
Once you are in the settings, you can select to create a new cashier. It will prompt you to allocate a name to the cashier, which could either be the name of the receptionist or just a generic name if you are sharing the cashier.

You can select which currencies you would like to allow the user to accept.

All of the users in the system display below the name, and you can tick the users that you would like to give access to the cashier. Once these users are ticked and saved in the system, they will immediately see a new icon on their screen allowing them to use the cashier.

Within these settings you can also tick the box "Currency Exchange.” This option will activate the currency exchange for your hotel. You can set up the currency exchange with the fair rate, with a percentage commission, or with a fixed commission.

**Note**: every user who accepts money, **MUST** be assigned to a cashier. If a user who is not assigned a cashier, accepts money, and posts this on a guest bill, the money bill not be communicated to the cashier, and you will end up with an unbalanced cashier.

####Opening your Cashier
Once your cashier is set up, it will open with a 0 Opening balance.

Usually you start your shift with a minimum opening balance, so that you have some change in your cash desk to pay back to customers who do not pay their bill with an exact amount. To set the opening balance at the beginning of the system, select "New Transaction" and post the amount of money received in the "Value Received" field with a note, describing this is the initial balance setup.
Once you have set up your initial balance correctly, you can start using the cashier, taking in money, paying out, directly from guest bills or in the cashier.

Note: if you are posting cash which is linked to revenue, you must post this on the Guest Profile Billing Screen, so that the system required firstly for revenue to be posted, which is then balanced against cash. If you post cash directly in the cashier, we will not post "revenue" against it, so its considered a simply cash exchange, which does not impact accounting report.
- Example 1: if you send a team member to a shot to buy bananas, you would do a paid out directly from the cashier, and the receipt will need to be included in the shift-drop as "cash". In this case only a payment is posted in the cashier, not impacting accounting reports.
- Example 2: if a customer pays for a minibar item in cash, you have to go to his Guest Profile, first post the minibar item, and then post the cash. So that both revenue and payment are posted.

####Closing your Cashier
- At the end of the shift, you need to count the money you have in your physical cash drawer.
- Select the "Close Shift" button in the cashier
- The system will ask you to which "base value" you would like to return the cashier once you close the shift. This value needs to be the base value of the money you would like to remain in the desk, for the next shift to start with (so for example 200 Euro in change). So if you put 200 Euro in that field, the system will calculate:
"End Value of Cashier" minus "Base Value" = "Shift Drop Amount", and it will post this amount on a report, which you need to then give to your accountant (together with the money)

Once the shift is closed, the Opening Balance will start with 200 Euro (in this example).

<a name="Services-and-Stay-Services"></a>
###Services and Stay Services
In order to create chargeable services, you will need to set up each service and its sub-services in this section. The screen is divided in 2 sections:

1. **Services**: These are general services the hotels sells, such as the minibar, transfers, food&beverage, etc. and can be posted also manually from the Guest Profile - Billing Screen. At the same time if you want to create services for the Navigator, you will need to set them up in this section.
2. **Stay Services**: This is where accommodation rates, cancellation conditions and rate management is done. This is also the section where you set up products that can be packaged with the accommodation, such as breakfast, city tax, etc.

###Services
To create a new service, press the "New Service" button.

To create services, you have to follow the following logic, as the system of services is set up in 3 layers, and you must follow these layers for the services to work in the Navigator

Level 1: Service Category (For example "Room Service)
  Level 2: Product Category (For example "Starters" or "Main Courses")
    Level 3: Products (For example: "Coca Cola Light"
If you follow this logic, the services will be built according to the structure of the system, and they will display beautifully in the Navigator, but also on the billing screen in the Mews Commander.

When setting a "New Service" it will provide the user with a multitude of options:

- **Name**: Select the name of the service, as you would like it to display on guest bills.
- **Description**: This field is important when you want to sell the product on the Navigator, as this is the description that is displayed to your guests.
- **Ordering**: This will allow ordering of the items in the menu. Items with the lowest ordering number will display first, items with higher ordering numbers will appear later in the selection.
- **Currency**: A service can be set up in different currencies. Note that if you set the main product in a currency (i.e. Minibar) then all the items that fall within this product category (Coca Cola, beer, etc.) are priced in the same currency.
- **Amount**: The price of the product.
- **Tax Rate**: Set the correct tax rate for the product. If you are unsure, it is recommended to check this with your accountant/financial department.
- **E-mail**: if you would like a confirmation of the order to be sent to guests, this field is the e-mail field from which the confirmation e-mail will be sent. So the guest will respond to that e-mail if he/she has any questions with regards to the service.

####Options
- **Bill Packaged**: if you want items which are posted as part of this Service to be packaged, select this option, and then on each item that you would like to package, you select again "package" and it will merge these items together on guest bills (but not in internal reports)
- **Has Expanded Bill Items**: if you want to display all sub products ordered, on guest bills, as individual items. If you tick this, it will print each product as 1 line item on the bill, if you untick this option, the bill will display 1 line with a summary header only and a total amount. Again, in your internal reporting all products will still be split out separately.
- **Has Overridable Price**: if you would like to allow your reception to override the standard price set for this service and its sub-products, when they manually post items against this service.
- **Has Overridable Tax**: this will allow your reception to change the VAT level on a product posting. We would recommend against using this, as often the reception team is not aware which VAT is used on which product, and this needs to be set up as black-and-white as possible to avoid errors.
- **Is Directly Orderable By Customer**: if you select this, it makes the prodcut available on the Navigator for sale.
- **Is Externally Chargeable**: if you select this, and have a connected POS system, the Point Of Sales system can charge items against this service.
- **Is Retrospectively Orderable**: this option is important if you want to allow reception to post this item manually on bills, if you do not tick this, the product does not become available for manual postings.
- **New Order Is Processed**: this option is important to have ticked if the item is used by reception to post items manually on bills. If you do not tick this option, once the service is posted, you will be asked to manually "process the order" creating additional unnecessary work. This is only important for order from the Navigator, which require an employee to pick up the order and process it.
- **Orderable only with products**: if you select this option, it will not be possible for someone in the team (or a guest on the Navigator) to order the Service, without having selected any of its sub-products. (Its like ordering Room Service, without selecting the menu items that you have, so there is nothing to deliver)  
- **Order Generates E-mail**: if you have set up a Responsible Employee, and you select this option, the employee who is set up as responsible  will be receiving e-mail confirmation once the product is ordered.
- **Order Generates Notification**: if you have set up a Responsible Employee, and you select this option, the employee who is set up as responsible will be receiving dashboard notifications directly in the Mews Commander every time the service is ordered.
- **Order Has End**: this option is ONLY applicable for Accommodation, which must have a start and end date. Ignore this setting for any other services.
- **Order Has Start**: this option is applicable to services that have a start date. This is especially important for products in the Navigator, that are being ordered by the guest, and the reception needs to be informed of the start date/time of the serivce. So for example if the guest ordered a City Tour, Spa Treatment or Taxi, the reception will need to know at what time this service is requested. Ticking it, makes the time field a "obligatory field" not allowing anyone to order the service without setting the time/date first.
- **Order Requires Completed Notes**: some products, when posted require notes to be filled in. This is again mostly applicable for products from the Navigator. For example if a guest orders a taxi, we require him to specify the location/details of his pickup, thus it makes sense to make the "notes" field obligatory.

####Responsibility
In this field you can select the Employee who is responsible for this service. So when in the aforementioned options, you have selected that you want to receive notifications or e-mails, the system will send these to the responsible person automatically upon the ordering of the product.

####E-mail
**Order E-mail**: If you would like to send your customer an e-mail at the time of the order of the Service, you can type the e-mail in HTML in this field. Once the product is ordered by the customer (via Navigator or directly in the Commander), the system will trigger to send an e-mail to the guest. Of course we can only send confirmation e-mail to guests who have a valid e-mail address in their Guest Profile.

**End E-mail**: for some services, such as Accommodation, you may want to send an e-mail as a follow up once the service ends, to ask them how the service was enjoyed, or ask for feedback. Note that we can only send an end-email for services that have an end-date. At this moment, we only recommend setting this for Accommodation Services.

####Accounting
All products can be assigned Accounting Categories, which are the revenue buckets to which the product is being processed. There are 4 categories for which accounting categories are requestes:
- **Accounting Category**: this is the most important field to complete, as this is the accounting category for normal posting of the products
- **Cancellation Fee Accounting Category**: this is only applicable to products that have an automatic cancellation fee set up. Currently only Accommodation can have a cancellation fee set up automatically. So ignore this field for all other services.
- **Refund Accounting Category**: this is only applicable to products that have an automatic refund possibility set up. Currently only Accommodation can have a refunds set up automatically. So ignore this field for all other services.
- **Positive & Negative Deposit Accounting Category**: again, this is only applicable for Accommodation, and only in countries where the "deposit" functionality is used such as in Czech Republic and Germany (where VAT is paid at the time of deposits). So ignore this field for all other services.

####Promotions
Currently only the option "After Check-in" has live functionality in the Navigator. If you tick this option, in the Navigator, once you complete your online check-in, we will promote that service to the customer. This will help promote services such as a taxi pickup from the airport.

####Image
All Services / Product Categories / Products have the possibility to upload an image. If you are setting up the Navigator we highly recommend setting up photos for all 3 sections, because it will really personalize the Navigator to your hotel, rather than just showing generic images for different services.








<a name="Creating-Products"></a>
###Creating Product Categories and Products

<a name="Product-Category"></a>
####Product Category

Within the “Product,” you can create a "New Product Category" or a "New Product.” To give an example:

1. Service: Minibar
2. Product Category: Food
3. Product: Mars Bar

**Product Category**: When you create a new category, you have the following options:

- Name & Description: Should your hotel have the Mews Navigator, then the description field is important as this will appear on the Navigator.
- Parent Category: If you would like to make a sub-division in the categories.
Once you have created the category, you can create products inside the category by pressing "New Product"

<a name="Guide-Product"></a>
####Product

When setting the “Product,” there are a few options:

- **Consumed Before Night**: This product has been “consumed” (read: posted) prior to midnight of the accommodation posting. For example, this could be a halfboard package where a customer has dinner before the accommodation.
- **Always Included**: If this option is selected, it will be an obligatory product that is packaged with the rate. For example, this could be the case if a hotel only sells rooms inclusive of breakfast.
- **Included By Default**: This option is only applicable if you have the Mews Distributor implemented. If this option is selected, the product will be included by default but can be removed from the rate-package. This could be the case if you mostly sell rooms inclusive of breakfast, so you pre-tick the breakfast, but if a customer books, they can remove the tick from this box to exclude breakfast.
- **Cost Included In Night**: This feature will allow you to absorb a product (such as breakfast) into the night cost. It will not display this item (that is being absorbed) on the bill of the guest.
- **Include When**: Here you can determine whether you would like the product to be included when it is a specific type of customer (for example a "Leisure" or "Business" customer). An example of this could be a city tax, which is charged as part of the price.
- **Product Charging**: “Once” would charge the item only once during a stay. “Per Room Night” would charge the product each room night, independent of how many people are staying in the room. “Per Bed Night” charges the product per person per night.
- **Channel Manager ID**: This is only applicable if the channel manager supports the product and sells both inclusive and exclusive options of this product online.

<a name="Stay-Services"></a>
###Stay Services

<a name="Basic-Settings"></a>
####Basic Stay Settings

This section explains how to set the hotel rates and cancellation conditions, how to set up package items to rates, and how to create voucher codes.

**Basic Rate Settings** - The initial screen with rate conditions, are the conditions that apply to all rates. Most of the fields are the same in the "Services" settings with the following exceptions:

- **Reservation Max Length**: A hotel may want to set the maximum length of a reservation, so if you have a request that is longer than the max period, it will not offer availability.
- **Reservation Default Type**: Select either “Leisure” or “Business,” which will affect whether all new bookings automatically come in as Leisure or Business. After the bookings have downloaded or have been created in the system under the default stay type, you can manually change the purpose of the stay. Countries may have different city tax regulations, and this may be dependent on the reservation type.
- **Packages**: On this screen you can also add products. If you would like to package products as part of the rate, this is the screen to do so. Select "Add Product," and you will be able to create items such as breakfast, cleaning fee, city tax, halfboard, etc. The settings of these products are described in the aforementioned **Product** section.

**Rate and Vouchers**: Each standard setup of a hotel is done with a basic rate, which is considered the BAR rate, off which the other rates may or may not float. This section is split into another 2 sub-categories.

- **Rates**: An overview of all the different rates that have been set. Here you can quickly identify whether a rate is a voucher rate (only bookable with a voucher code, travel agent or company profile attached) and whether the rate is enabled.
- **Vouchers**: This is an overview of all the vouchers that have been set up. Each voucher can only be assigned to either a company or a travel agent. Also, it is important that when creating the voucher, you select the rates that you would like to apply to this voucher. (All voucher rates are displayed in the selection field). Lastly, you can create a number of voucher codes, which can be used directly in the Mews Distributor or Commander when booking a room.

<a name="Setting-BAR"></a>
####Setting the Best Available Rate

- **Name**: Name this field correctly with its full name, as this is the rate that is visible to the customer directly in the Mews Distributor.
- **Short Name**: Create a short name for all the rates, as this will display better in report columns.
- **Ordering**: This put a numerical order into the list of rates in the earlier "Rates" section.
- **Payment Conditions**: Here there are 2 options, and it is of the upmost importance that you select the correct one. “On Site” will lock the exchange rate only on the day of arrival, as the payment is expected during the guest’s stay. “In Advance” will lock the exchange rate on the day of booking, as this is a pre-paid rate, which will be charged on the day of booking.
- **Pricing**: Once you have set above settings, select the pricing tab where you will be able to set up the prices for this rate. First, set the "Base Price,” which is the base from which all other room types float. Ensure that you select the correct currency in the base rate, as this will affect the sales currency of the hotel. Once you have set the base rate, it will update all future dates with this rate. The base rate is the sales rate, inclusive of VAT, but exclusive of products (such as breakfast).
- **Empty Bed Adjustment**: Rooms are sold inclusive of VAT and are assumed to be for the base number of people the room can accommodate in regular beds (not taking into account extra beds). If the hotel differentiates its pricing if you , for example, go from double, to single, you can fill in the value with which the rate should drop. Note that in order to lower the rate you have to fill in a negative value (for example: -10)
- **Extra Bed Adjustment**: Same as above. The room is assumed to be sold a full capacity of beds, however if you have the possibility to place 1 or more extra beds, in this field you can put the value with how much you would like to charge an extra bed.
- **Room Type Adjustments**: Once you have set the base rate, you can chose the base room (usually the lowest room category) from which you would like to set the rate adjustments for the other rooms. Directly next to the room in the "Value" column, you can select the room adjustment and by which value you would like to increase the rate for that room type.
- **Relative Adjustments**: If you change the base price on a specific date, it will increase or decrease all rooms on that date in relation to the base price. So, if you increase the base price by 20 Euros, it will increase all rooms by 20 Euros. This is what we call a relative rate adjustment, which keeps the relations between rates stable.
- **Override Adjustment**: You can also decide to put an override adjustment on 1 specific room type, if occupancy of that room is exceptionally high, and you want to raise the rate on that room only. You can click directly on the rate in the room type to set the override. Note that if you set an override adjustment on a room type, it will ignore any further "Relative Adjustments,” until you delete the "override adjustment".
- **Options**: Once you have set the rates for the upcoming months/years, you need to complete the options. This field handles cancellation conditions and rate restrictions.

<a name="Cancellation-Conditions"></a>
#####**Cancellation Conditions**

The system calculates which cancellation conditions should be charged to guests based on the time of the cancellation. Let’s say you have a rate with a cancellation policy of 24 hours prior to arrival. The system knows that your check-in time is 15:00, so if you cancel the reservation at 14:59 the day prior, it knows not to charge any fee. If it were one minute later, however, it would correctly post cancellation fees.

- To set a new cancellation condition, select the button "New Cancellation Policy" in the "Options" section of rates. You can select for the specific rate type how many days prior the guest is allowed to cancel free of charge. If the guest cannot cancel, then leave this field black.
- Cancellation Fee Fixed: If you want to charge a fixed cancellation fee, put the amount in this field.
- Cancellation Fee Percentage: If you want to charge a percentage, complete the field here.
- Cancellation Fee Maximum Nights: This is an important field that requires careful attention. If you complete it with the number “1”, it will charge 1 night cancellation fee (adjusted by the cancellation fee percentage). If you complete it with “0”, it will not charge any cancellation fee. If you leave the field blank, it will charge the reservation fully, adjusted by the cancellation percentage.

<a name="Rate-Restrictions"></a>
#####Rate Restrictions

You have the possibility to set rate restrictions, which will affect the availability of the rate. You can set restrictions that require minimum length of stay, set close out dates or set minimum days it should be booked in advance.

- New Length Restriction: If you wish to set a minimum or maximum length of a booking, here you can select the amount of days for which you would like to apply this. For example, if you set a minimum length of stay as 3 nights, it will only offer this rate to people who select 3 nights or longer. It is important that you select "Only For Current Rate," otherwise it will apply this rule to all rates.
- New Earliness Restriction: You can create rates that are only available up to X nights before arrival. So, for example, you can set this as 21 days, and in that case, the rate will only be bookable 21 days and more in advance. It is important that you select "Only For Current Rate" otherwise it will apply this rule to all rates.
- New Amount Restriction: In order to prevent you accidentally selling rates that are too low, you can set a minimum amount, and the system will not allow you to lower any rate below this point.
- New Date Restriction: If you would like to create a specific period of time when you would not like the rate to be bookable or when you would like to create a specific period of time when you would only like to offer this special rate.

<a name="Setting-Dependent-Rates"></a>
####Setting Dependent Rates (Floating Rates)

Once you have set up your "Best Available Rate" in the system, you can create rates that float off this BAR rate at discounted percentages. One such example is a “Non-Refundable Rate,” which, for example, you can set at a 10% discount from the BAR rate. The system will automatically calculate the discount for all room types, saving a lot of work for revenue and reservations managers.

Some examples of rates that can float:
- Non-Refundable Rate
- Advance Purchase Rates: For example, if you wish to give a discount for guests who book 21 days in advance. You must ensure that you set a "New Earliness Restriction" (see above).
- Long Stay Rates: For example, if a customer books 7 days or longer, they would receive a 15% discount. You must ensure that you set a "Length Restriction" (see above).

To set up a new **Non-Refundable Rate**

1. In the **Stay** screen, select the "New Rate" button to start creating a new rate.
2. **Base Rate**: Select the rate from which you would like to float a discounted rate. Be very careful with this field. Once you have created a rate floating off another rate, you cannot change it (and you would have to delete it completely and rebuild it if you did need to change it). It is recommended to float the rate off the BAR rate.
3. **Voucher Rate**: If you would like to offer this rate only to specific travel agents or companies or with a special booking code (for the booking engine), you need to select this box. However if you would like the rate to be publicly available, then do not tick the box.
4. **Name**: Name this field correctly with its full name, as this is the rate that is visible to the customer directly in the Mews Distributor.
5. **Short Name**: Create a short name for all rates, as this will display better in report columns.
6. **Payment Conditions**: Here there are 2 options, and it is of the upmost importance that you select the correct one. “On Site” will lock the exchange rate only on the day of arrival, as the payment is expected during the guest’s stay. “In Advance” will lock the exchange rate on the day of booking, as this is a pre-paid rate, which will be charged on the day of booking.
7. Create the rate, and in the next screen, you need to "Enable" it by ticking the box and setting the discount in either a percentage or absolute amount (in the set currency).
8. **Options**: See the full explanation of the different options in the BAR explanation.

<a name="Setting-Independent-Rates"></a>
####Setting Independent Rates (Travel Agent / Corporate Rates)

You can set up rates that are not floating off the BAR (or any other rate). These need to be set manually. Typical examples of this are Wholesale Rates or Contracted Corporate Rates.

1. In the **Stay** screen, select the "New Rate" button to start creating a new rate
2. **Base Rate**: Do not select any base rate, as this will allow you to manage the rates manually.
3. **Voucher Rate**: If you are creating a rate that is only applicable for certain companies or travel agencies, then select this button.
4. **Payment Type**: Here there are 2 options, and it is of the upmost importance that you select the correct one. “On Site” will lock the exchange rate only on the day of arrival, as the payment is expected during the guest’s stay. “In Advance” will lock the exchange rate on the day of booking, as this is a pre-paid rate, which will be charged on the day of booking.
5. Once you create the rate, in the next screen you need to "Enable" it by ticking the box and setting the discount in either a percentage or absolute amount (in the set currency).
6. **Options**: See the full explanation of the different options in the BAR explanation.
7. **Pricing**: Once you have enabled the rate, select the pricing tab. Here you can complete the pricing for the entire contracted period of this travel agent or company.

Once you have created the voucher rate, you will need to connect the rate to the specific company/travel agent for whom the rate should be made available. Do this in the "New Booking" screen once the company is selected.

1. Return to the **Stay** overview in the settings where you can see all the rates.
2. Select the button "**New Voucher**"
3. **Name the Voucher/Code**: It is recommended that you give the voucher a name that is logical, so that in the reservation report, you can quickly identify the rate.
4. **Company/Travel Agent**: Select the company or travel agent to whom you would like to attach the rate.
5. **Assigned Rates**: You will see a list of all voucher rates, and you will need to select the rates which you would like to make bookable for that specific company/agent.
6. Once you have created the connection between the rate and company or travel agent, press OK, and the connection will be functional. You can now create a new booking, and when you select the dates and the respective company/travel agent name, the system will offer the specific rates.
7. If you have the **Mews Distributor** (Booking Engine), you are also able to create vouchers, which can be provided to a customer booking directly on your hotel website. Select "New Voucher,” and complete the code you wish to use and the period during which the voucher should be bookable. Once saved, you are able to provide this code to your clients for direct bookings.

###Cultures, Taxation and Number Settings

####Number Precision
Currently, the precision of costs in the system (e.g. night cost, minibar item cost) is dependent on the currencies in which the items are priced. And the precision is the smallest unit of that currency - 1 CZK, 0.01 EUR, 0.01 USD etc. So it's not possible to set price of something to 1.2 CZK, 1.234 CZK or 1.234 EUR. Thanks to that, the bills don't have to contain a "rounding" item (halerove zaokrouhleni) because the sum is always payable using the currency.

It's possible to set up custom precision of VAT calculation, which means that even though the items are always rounded to whole crowns, the NET and VAT calculated can be more precise.

In order to set this precision, contact your Mews representative.

####Cultural Settings
In czech culture (can be set in your profile) the decimal places are separated by comma "," and thousands can be optionally separated by spaces (e.g. "1 234 567,89"). In english US culture, there is decimal point "." and thousands can be optionally separated by commas "," (e.g. "1,234,567.89").
